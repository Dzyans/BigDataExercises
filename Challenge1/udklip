The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two [[Conference (sports)|conferences]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States. This conference and its counterpart, the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), currently contain 16 teams each, making up the 32 teams of the NFL. Both conferences were created as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|1970 merger]] with the rival [[American Football League]] (AFL), with all ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams forming the AFC, and the remaining thirteen NFL clubs forming the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making the current total 16 clubs per each conference.

Since the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, the [[New England Patriots]] have won nine AFC titles, the most of any team in the conference (and of any team in either conference since the merger), and are its current title holder.

==Current teams==
Since 2002, the AFC has 16 teams, organized into four [[Division (sport)|divisions]] each with four teams: [[AFC East|East]], [[AFC North|North]], [[AFC South|South]] and [[AFC West|West]].

This chart of the [[2016 NFL season#Regular_season_standings|2016 season standings]] displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The [[2016 New England Patriots season|Patriots in 2016]] (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the [[AFC East]]. Thus, [[2017 New England Patriots season|in 2017]], the Patriots will play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the [[AFC West]] and [[NFC South]] (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the [[AFC North]] and [[AFC South]] (highlighted in orange).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Currently, the thirteen opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Opponents Determined|url=http://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2012-opponents-determined.pdf|publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012|date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each AFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to 10 other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC South. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.

At the end of each season, the top six teams in the conference proceeds into the [[National Football League playoffs|playoff]]. These teams consist of the four division winners and the top two [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams. The AFC playoffs culminate in the [[AFC Championship Game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC Champion then plays the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Champion in the [[Super Bowl]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Oldafclogo.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Original American Football Conference logo, based on the AFL logo with blue stars]]
Both the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL [[AFL–NFL merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-fo055624a&amp;article_id=608&amp;chapter_id=13&amp;chapter_title=Sports&amp;article_title=Pro_Football_History|title=Pro Football – History|accessdate=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1966 and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in 1968) before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL's launch (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Baltimore Colts]]) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions [[AFL East]] and [[AFL West]] were more or less intact, while the Century Division, in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central.

Since the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|2002 realignment]]. The expansion [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the AFC in 1995. There have been five teams that have relocated at least once. In 1984, the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|relocated]] to Indianapolis in 1984. In 1995, the [[Cleveland Browns]] had attempted to move to Baltimore, the resulting [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|dispute]] between Cleveland and the team, led to Modell establishing the [[Baltimore Ravens]] with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL.

In California, the [[Oakland Raiders]] relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, and Back to Oakland in 1995, while the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] moved to Los Angeles in 2017.

The [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] moved to [[Tennessee]] in 1997, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers. The team would change its name again, two years later, to the [[Tennessee Titans]].

The NFL would again expand in 2002, adding the [[Houston Texans]] to the AFC.

Between 2000 and 2016, the AFC has sent either the [[Baltimore Ravens]] (2 times), the [[Denver Broncos]] (2 times), the [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2 times), the [[Oakland Raiders]] (1 time), the [[New England Patriots]] (7 times), and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (3 times) to the [[Super Bowl]]. By contrast, the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] has sent 12 different teams during that same time frame. 14 of the last 17 AFC champions have started one of just three quarterbacks - [[Tom Brady]], [[Peyton Manning]], and [[Ben Roethlisberger]] - in the Super Bowl.

==Logo==
[[Image:American Football Conference logo old.svg|right|thumb|2nd American Football Conference logo used from 1970 to 2009|216x216px]]
The merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the &quot;A&quot; and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |title=But I Absolutely Refuse to Write About the Draft Caps |author=Paul Lukas |publisher=Uni Watch blog |accessdate=16 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506134900/http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |archivedate=6 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Animal Farm''''' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] novella by [[George Orwell]], first published in England on 17 August 1945. According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/george-orwells-animal-farm-historical-context-pt-1-3/8177.html|title= GCSE English Literature – 'Animal Farm' – historical context (pt 1/3)|work=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1936) (''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell Volume 1 – An Age Like This 1945–1950'' p.&amp;nbsp;23 (Penguin))&lt;/ref&gt; was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bowker, ''Orwell'' p.&amp;nbsp;224 ; Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''The Spanish Cockpit'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and &quot;Spilling the Spanish Beans&quot;, ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal [[dictatorship]], built upon a [[cult of personality]] and enforced by [[Great purge|a reign of terror]].  In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin (&quot;''un conte satirique contre Staline''&quot;),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, &quot;to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole&quot;.

The original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story;'' U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like &quot;''A Satire''&quot; and &quot;''A Contemporary Satire''&quot;.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''Union des républiques socialistes animales'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for &quot;bear&quot;, a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}

Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the UK was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/robert-pearce/animal-farm-sixty-years|title=Animal Farm: Sixty Years On|work=historytoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickstein, Morris. ''Cambridge Companion to Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;134&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]]. It won a Retrospective [[Hugo Award]] in 1996, and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.

== Plot summary ==
[[Old Major]], the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as &quot;enemies&quot; and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called &quot;[[Beasts of England]]&quot;. When Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] from the farm, renaming it &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, &quot;All animals are equal.&quot;

Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[#Animalism|Animalism]].  Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly.  The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.

Some time later, several men attack Animal Farm. Jones and his men are making an attempt to recapture the farm, aided by several other farmers who are terrified of similar animal revolts. Snowball and the animals, who are hiding in ambush, defeat the men by launching a surprise attack as soon as they enter the farmyard. Snowball's popularity soars, and this event is proclaimed &quot;The Battle of the Cowshed&quot;. It is celebrated annually with the firing of a gun, on the anniversary of the Revolution.

Napoleon and Snowball vie for pre-eminence. When Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a [[windmill]], Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader.

Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project. Once Snowball becomes a [[scapegoat]], Napoleon begins to [[purge]] the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Jones', while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle. &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones.

[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr Frederick]], one of the neighbouring farmers, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who &quot;could read as well as any pig&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orwell, George |date=1946|title=Animal Farm|location= London|publisher= Penguin Group|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; notices that the van belongs to a [[knacker]] and attempts a futile rescue. Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. In a subsequent report, Squealer reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital; the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways. However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [[whisky]] for themselves. (In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into [[animal glue]].)

{{anchor|moreEqual}}
Years pass, and the windmill is rebuilt along with construction of another windmill, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating and running water are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the Revolution are dead, as is Farmer Jones, who died in another part of England. The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: &quot;All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others&quot;. Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name &quot;The Manor Farm&quot;. As the animals look from pigs to humans, they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two.

*'''The piglets''' – Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.
*'''The young pigs''' – Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first animals killed in Napoleon's farm purge. Based on the [[Great Purge]] of [[Grigori Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Nikolai Bukharin]], and [[Alexei Rykov]].
*'''Pinkeye''' – A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the pig that tastes Napoleon's food to make sure it is not poisoned, in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.

===Humans===

*'''[[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr Jones]]''' – A heavy drinker who is the original owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of Russian [[Tsar Nicholas II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= | first= | url=http://www.shmoop.com/animal-farm/fall-mister-jones-russian-revolution-1917-symbol.html | title= The Fall of Mister Jones and the Russian Revolution of 1917| publisher=Shmoop University | accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who abdicated following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and was murdered, along with the rest of his family, by the [[Bolsheviks]] on 17 July 1918.

The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [[cockfighting]] (a likely allegory for the human rights abuses of [[Adolf Hitler]]). Napoleon enters into an alliance with Frederick in order to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and detonating the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa]].
*'''[[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr Pilkington]]''' – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Unlike Frederick, Pilkington is wealthier and owns more land, but his farm is in need of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently-run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones, and worried that this could also happen to him.
*'''Mr Whymper''' – A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first he is used to acquire necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits and [[paraffin wax]], but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.

===Horses and donkeys ===

*'''[[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]]''' – A loyal, kind, dedicated, extremely strong, hard working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible. Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that 'Napoleon is always right'. At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to the [[Stakhanovite movement]]. He has been described as &quot;faithful and strong&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30047391|pages=17–19|last1=Sutherland|first1=T.|title=Speaking My Mind: Orwell Farmed for Education|volume=95|issue=1|journal=The English Journal|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40176954|pages=11–63|last1=Roper|first1=D.|title=Viewpoint 2: The Boxer Mentality|volume=9|issue=11|journal=Change|year=1977|doi=10.1080/00091383.1977.10569271}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [[knacker]] to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account falsifying Boxer's death.
*'''Mollie''' – A self-centred, self-indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution. She is only once mentioned again, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.
*'''Clover''' – A gentle, caring female horse, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot &quot;put words together&quot;. She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer.
*'''[[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]]''' – A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is sceptical, temperamental and cynical: his most frequent remark is, &quot;Life will go on as it has always gone on—that is, badly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell 1946 40&quot; /&gt; The academic Morris Dickstein has suggested there is &quot;a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless skepticism&quot;&lt;ref name=Dickstein141&gt;''Cambridge Companion to Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;141&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed, friends called Orwell &quot;Donkey George&quot;, &quot;after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in ''Animal Farm''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;236&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other animals===
*'''Muriel''' – A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. She, like Benjamin and Snowball, is one of the few animals on the farm who can read.
*'''The puppies''' – Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, they were taken away at birth by Napoleon and reared by him to be his security force.
*'''Moses''' – The raven, &quot;Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.&quot; Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called &quot;Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!&quot; Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as &quot;the black raven of priestcraft—promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.&quot; Napoleon brings the raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=Dickstein141/&gt; 
*'''The sheep''' – They show limited understanding of the Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm; yet nonetheless they blindly support Napoleon's ideals with vocal jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Some commentators&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wgkz4 Professor Robert Colls (Cultural History, De Montfort University) BBC In Our Time's episode on Animal Farm]&lt;/ref&gt; have compared the sheep to representations of state controlled press. Their constant bleating of &quot;four legs good, two legs bad&quot; was used as a device to drown out any opposition; analogous to simplistic headlines used in printed media of the age. Towards the latter section of the book, Squealer (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to &quot;four legs good, two legs better&quot;, which they dutifully do. Symbolizing the state manipulation of media.
*'''The hens''' – The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr Jones. However their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. The hens are among the first to rebel against Napoleon.
*'''The cows''' – The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen, but can be used to raise their own calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries. 
*'''The cat''' – Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven; because her excuses are so convincing and she &quot;purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually &quot;voted on both sides.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

==Composition and publication==

===Origin===
George Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him &quot;how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries&quot;. This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original socialist ideals.{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}

Immediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the [[BBC]]. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.&lt;ref&gt;[[Overy, Richard]], ''Why the Allies Won'', p.&amp;nbsp;297 {{ISBN|0-393-03925-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface, Orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}
{{quote
| ...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.
}}

===Efforts to find a publisher===
Orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 page 25 ''La libertà di stampa'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch—including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's &quot;good writing&quot; and &quot;fundamental integrity&quot;, but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint &quot;which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]]&quot;. Eliot said he found the view &quot;not convincing&quot;, and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue &quot;what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs&quot;.&lt;ref name=Eliot/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09-004&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09|title=T.S. Eliot and Animal Farm: Reasons for Rejection|last=Eliot|first=Valery|date=6 January 1969|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=8 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell let [[André Deutsch]], who was working for Nicholson &amp; Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson &amp; Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and &quot;lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in ''Animal Farm''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davison, editorial note, Orwell, Collected Works, ''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''London Letter'' on 17 April 1944 for ''[[Partisan Review]]'', Orwell wrote that it was &quot;now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle.&quot;

The publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;—although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy &amp; Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the 'important official' was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell Subverted p.3&quot;&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', Daniel J. Leab, Penn State Press, 2007 p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949. Born Hans Peter Smolka in Vienna in 1912, he came to Britain in 1933 as an [[NKVD]] agent with the codename 'Abo',&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;210; The Mitrokhin Archive, The KGB in Europe and the West, Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, p.&amp;nbsp;158&lt;/ref&gt; became a naturalised British subject in 1938, changed his name, and after the outbreak of World War II joined the Ministry of Information where he organised pro-Soviet propaganda, working with [[Kim Philby]] in 1943–45.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordievsky, Oleg]]. ''KGB: The Inside Story'', 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;325&lt;/ref&gt; Smollett's family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orwell Subverted p.3&quot;/&gt; The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
{{quote |
If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.

Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.
}}

[[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],&lt;ref&gt;''George Orwell, A Personal Memoir'', T. R. Fyvel, p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;/ref&gt; which had played a major part in defeating Hitler. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.&lt;ref&gt;[[Struve, Gleb]]. ''Telling the Russians'', written for the Russian journal ''New Russian Wind'', reprinted in Remembering Orwell, pp.260–61&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] might illustrate ''Animal Farm''. Low had written a letter saying that he had had &quot;a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM''—an excellent bit of satire—it would illustrate perfectly.&quot; Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker &amp; Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.&lt;ref&gt;Smothered Under Journalism, p. 123 &amp; I Belong to the Left, pp. 313–14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preface===
Orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:
{{quote|The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary.... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.}}
Although the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included,{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}} and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ba|Bailey83221]] (Bailey83221 includes a preface and two cites: 26 August 1995 ''The Guardian'' p. 28; 26 August 1995 ''New Statesman &amp; Society'' 8 (366): 11. {{ISSN|0954-2361}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Secker and Warburg published the first edition of ''Animal Farm'' in 1945 without an introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript. For reasons unknown, no preface was supplied, and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute.&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt;&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt;

In 1972, [[Ian Angus (librarian)|Ian Angus]] found the original typescript titled &quot;The Freedom of the Press&quot;, and [[Bernard Crick]] published it, together with his own introduction, in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 15 September 1972&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt; as &quot;How the essay came to be written&quot;.&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crick/&gt; Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.&lt;ref name=TFOTP/&gt; The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition of ''Animal Farm'' with another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface.&lt;ref name=GOIT15/&gt; Other publishers were still declining to publish it.{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=more details needed, were some actively refusing, unaware of the preface?}}

==Critical response==
Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive.  Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it &quot;puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly.&quot; Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations, and said, &quot;It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114852/1946-review-george-orwells-animal-farm|title=1946 Review of George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' |author=George Soule|work=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' on 24 August 1945 called ''Animal Farm'' &quot;a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian19450824&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1945/aug/24/georgeorwell.classics|title=Books of the day – Animal Farm|work=The Guardian|date=24 August 1945|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' on the same day, called the book &quot;a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us.&quot; [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September, &quot;Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State—Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point.&quot;

''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, ''Collected Works, I Belong to the Left'', p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===Animalism===
{{redirect|Seven Commandments|the Noahide code|Seven Laws of Noah}}

The pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into &quot;a complete system of thought&quot;, which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference to [[Communism]]. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an [[allusion]] to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.&lt;ref name=Rodden1999/&gt;
[[File:Animal Farm artwork.jpg|thumb|Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii) – preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by [[Norman Pett]] and Donald Freeman]]

The original commandments are:
# Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.
# Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
# No animal shall wear clothes.
# No animal shall sleep in a bed.
# No animal shall drink alcohol.
# No animal shall kill any other animal.
# All animals are equal.

These commandments are also distilled into the maxim &quot;Four legs good, two legs '''bad!'''&quot; which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism.

Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause.'''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Eventually, these are replaced with the maxims, &quot;All animals are equal '''but some animals are more equal than others'''&quot;, and &quot;Four legs good, two legs '''better!'''&quot; as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political [[dogma]] can be turned into malleable [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name=Carr2010/&gt;

===Significance and allegory===
[[File:Animalism flag.svg|thumb|left|The Horn and Hoof Flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]], the Communist symbol.]]

In the [[Eastern Bloc]], both ''Animal Farm'' and later ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' were on the list of forbidden books until the [[Revolutions of 1989|end of communist rule in 1989]], and were only available via clandestine [[Samizdat]] networks.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}

Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, &quot;virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory.&quot; Orwell himself wrote in 1946, &quot;Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution..[and] ''that kind'' of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert.&quot;&lt;ref name=OrwellLIL334/&gt; In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Bernard. ''Orwell, A Life'', p.&amp;nbsp;450&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution]]. The ''Battle of the Cowshed'' has been said to represent the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|allied invasion]] of [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1918,&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot; /&gt; and the defeat of the [[White movement|White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot; /&gt; The pigs' rise to pre-eminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence. The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, &quot;the turning point of the story&quot; as Orwell termed it in a letter to [[Dwight Macdonald]],&lt;ref name=OrwellLIL334&gt;Orwell, George. ''A Life in Letters'', Penguin {{ISBN|978-0-141-19263-5}} p.&amp;nbsp;334&lt;/ref&gt; stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt revolt]] against the Bolsheviks,&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Letter to Dwight Macdonald, 5 December 1946, ''A Life in Letters'', p.334 Penguin 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plans]]. The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure, and the pigs' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', 6–7 Daniel Leab, Penn State Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter seven, when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions and [[Moscow show trials|show trials]] of the late 1930s. These contributed to Orwell's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Companion to George Orwell, p.&amp;nbsp;135, CUP 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Edgerly Firchow]] and [[Peter Davison (professor)|Peter Davison]] consider that the ''Battle of the Windmill'' represents the [[Great Patriotic War]] ([[World War II]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008&quot; /&gt; especially the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Battle of Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Hobley Davison 1996&quot; /&gt; During the battle, Orwell first wrote, &quot;All the animals, including Napoleon&quot; took cover. Orwell had the publisher alter this to &quot;All the animals except Napoleon&quot; in recognition of Stalin's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.&lt;ref&gt;A Reader's Guide to George Orwell, Jeffrey Meyers, Thames &amp; Hudson, p.&amp;nbsp;142&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell requested the change after he met Joseph Czapski in Paris in March 1945. Czapski, a survivor of the [[Katyn Massacre]] and an opponent of the Soviet regime, told Orwell, as Orwell wrote to [[Arthur Koestler]], that it had been &quot;the character [and] greatness of Stalin&quot; that saved Russia from the German invasion.&lt;ref&gt;A Note on the Text, Peter Davison, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;xx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).jpg|thumb|Front row (left to right): [[Alexey Rykov|Rykov]], [[Mykola Skrypnyk|Skrypnyk]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] – 'When Snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep (Ch.

Other connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''A Readers Guide to George Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;135. In the Preface to ''Animal Farm'' Orwell noted however, 'although various episodes are taken from the actual history of the Russian Revolution, they are dealt with schematically and their chronological order is changed.'&lt;/ref&gt; include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutions [[Hungarian Revolution of 1919|in Hungary]] and [[German Revolution of 1918–19|in Germany]] (Ch IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (Ch V), paralleling &quot;the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another: [[Trotskyism]], with its faith in the [[Permanent revolution|revolutionary vocation]] of the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification of [[socialism in one country|Russia's socialist destiny]]&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Deutscher, quoted in Jeffrey Meyers, ''Readers Guide to George Orwell'', p.&amp;nbsp;138&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch VI), paralleling the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]]; and Frederick's forged bank notes, paralleling the [[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact of August 1939]], after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyers, p. 141&quot;/&gt;

The book's close, with the pigs and men in a kind of [[rapprochement]], reflected Orwell's view of the 1943 [[Teheran Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'',reprinted in Orwell:Collected Works, ''It Is What I Think'' p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; that seemed to display the establishment of &quot;the best possible relations between the USSR and the West&quot;—but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel.&lt;ref&gt;''Orwell Subverted'', p.&amp;nbsp;7, Daniel J. Leab, Penn State Press 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement between the allies and the start of the [[Cold War]] is suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, &quot;played an ace of spades simultaneously&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meyers, ''A Reader's Guide to George Orwell'' p.&amp;nbsp;142&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the music in the novel, starting with ''Beasts of England'' and the later anthems, parallels ''[[The Internationale]]'' and its adoption and repudiation by the Soviet authorities as the Anthem of the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s.

==Adaptations==
===Films===
''Animal Farm'' has been adapted to film twice. Both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties, including sanitising some aspects. 
*[[Animal Farm (1954 film)|''Animal Farm'']] (1954) is an animated feature in which Napoleon is apparently overthrown in a second revolution. In 1974, [[E. Howard Hunt]] revealed that he had been sent by the [[CIA]]'s [[Psychological Warfare]] department to obtain the film rights from Orwell's widow, and the resulting 1954 animation was funded by the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Chilton |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/how-cia-brought-animal-farm-to-the-screen/ |title=How the CIA brought Animal Farm to the screen |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=21 January 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Animal Farm (1999 film)|''Animal Farm'']] (1999) is a TV live action version that shows Napoleon's regime collapsing in on itself, with the farm having new human owners, reflecting the collapse of Soviet communism. 

In 2012, a HFR-3D version of ''Animal Farm'', potentially directed by [[Andy Serkis]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Giardina |first=Carolyn |title=Andy Serkis to Direct Adaptation of 'Animal Farm' |date=19 October 2012 |work=hollywoodreporter.com |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/andy-serkis-animal-farm-381314 |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio dramatizations===
A BBC radio version, produced by [[Rayner Heppenstall]], was broadcast in January 1947. Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square, London, with [[Hugh Gordon Porteus|Hugh Gordon Porteous]], amongst others. Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous, &quot;who had not read the book, grasped what was happening after a few minutes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davison, Peter (Editor)|title=The Lost Orwell|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A further radio production, again using Orwell's own dramatisation of the book, was broadcast in January 2013 on BBC [[Radio Four|Radio 4]]. [[Tamsin Greig]] narrated, and the cast included [[Nicky Henson]] as Napoleon, [[Toby Jones]] as the propagandist Squealer, and [[Ralph Ineson]] as Boxer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01q7fzf|title=The Real George Orwell, Animal Farm|website=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage productions===
A theatrical version, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by [[Adrian Mitchell]], was staged at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] London on 25 April 1984, directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]]. It toured nine cities in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Orwell, George|title=A Life in Letters|publisher= Penguin Books|date= 2011|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amphibians''' are [[ectotherm]]ic, [[tetrapod]] [[vertebrate]]s of the [[Class (biology)|class]] '''Amphibia'''. Modern amphibians are all [[Lissamphibia]]. They inhabit a wide variety of [[habitat]]s, with most species living within [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[fossorial]], [[arboreal]] or freshwater [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[ecosystem]]s. Thus amphibians typically start out as [[larva]]e living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo [[metamorphosis]] from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with [[lung]]s. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial [[salamander]]s and [[frog]]s lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to [[lizard]]s but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are [[amniote]]s and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often [[ecological indicator]]s; in recent decades there has been a dramatic [[decline in amphibian populations]] for many species around the globe.

The earliest amphibians [[evolution of tetrapods|evolved]] in the [[Devonian]] period from [[sarcopterygian]] fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass [[Lissamphibia]].

The three modern orders of amphibians are [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (the frogs and toads), [[Urodela]] (the salamanders), and [[caecilian|Apoda]] (the caecilians). The number of known amphibian species is approximately 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from [[New Guinea]] (''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'') with a length of just {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest living amphibian is the {{convert|1.8|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Chinese giant salamander]] (''Andrias davidianus''), but this is dwarfed by the extinct {{convert|9|m|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Prionosuchus]]'' from the middle Permian of Brazil. The study of amphibians is called [[batrachology]], while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called [[herpetology]].

The word &quot;amphibian&quot; is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] term ἀμφίβιος (''amphíbios''), which means &quot;both kinds of life&quot;, ''ἀμφί'' meaning &quot;of both kinds&quot; and ''βιος'' meaning &quot;life&quot;. The term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water, including seals and otters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |last=Skeat |first=Walter W. |year=1897 |publisher=Clarendon Press |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the class Amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes. Amphibia in its widest sense (''[[sensu lato]]'') was divided into three [[Class (biology)|subclasses]], two of which are extinct:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baird, Donald |date=May 1965 |title=Paleozoic lepospondyl amphibians |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=287–294 |doi=10.1093/icb/5.2.287 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Subclass [[Lepospondyli]]† (small Paleozoic group, which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than Lissamphibia)

** Caudata ([[salamander]]s, [[newt]]s and relatives): Jurassic to present—652 current species in 9 families

The actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed. The two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website AmphibiaWeb, [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the classification by [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] [[Darrel Frost]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]], available as the online reference database &quot;Amphibian Species of the World&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/ |title= American Museum of Natural History: Amphibian Species of the World 5.6, an Online Reference |author=Frost, Darrel |year=2013 |publisher=The American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of species cited above follows Frost and the total number of known amphibian species is over 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Crump, Martha L. |year=2009 |title=Amphibian diversity and life history |journal=Amphibian Ecology and Conservation.

With the [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] classification, the taxon [[Labyrinthodontia]] has been discarded as it is a [[Paraphyly|polyparaphyletic]] group without unique defining features apart from [[Cladistics#plesiomorphy|shared primitive characteristics]]. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a [[Cladistics#Three definitions of clade|stem-based or a node-based]] classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] have removed a large number of [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in [[Linnaean taxonomy]], and included them elsewhere under [[cladistic taxonomy]].&lt;ref name=BlackburnWake&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Blackburn, D.

All modern amphibians are included in the subclass Lissamphibia, which is usually considered a [[clade]], a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor. The three modern orders are Anura (the frogs and toads), Caudata (or Urodela, the salamanders), and Gymnophiona (or Apoda, the caecilians).{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=3 }} It has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a Temnospondyl-like ancestor, and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced [[reptiliomorpha|reptiliomorph]] amphibians, and thus of amniotes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot; /&gt; Although the fossils of several older proto-frogs with primitive characteristics are known, the oldest &quot;true frog&quot; is ''[[Prosalirus bitis]]'', from the [[Early Jurassic]] [[Kayenta Formation]] of Arizona.

Authorities disagree as to whether Salientia is a superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. The Lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three [[Order (biology)|orders]], but an extinct salamander-like family, the [[Albanerpetontidae]], is now considered part of Lissamphibia alongside the superorder Salientia. Furthermore, Salientia includes all three recent orders plus the Triassic proto-frog, ''[[Triadobatrachus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Salientia/14938 |title=Salientia |author=Cannatella, David |year=2008 |work=Tree of Life Web Project |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major groups of amphibians developed in the [[Devonian]] period, around 370 million years ago, from [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]] which were similar to the modern [[coelacanth]] and [[lungfish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/AnimalEvolution.shtml#evolutionofamphibian |title=Evolution of amphibians |publisher=University of Waikato: Plant and animal evolution |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required.

Many examples of species showing [[transitional fossil|transitional features]] have been discovered. ''[[Ichthyostega]]'' was one of the first primitive amphibians, with nostrils and more efficient lungs. It had four sturdy limbs, a neck, a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe-finned fish, ''[[Eusthenopteron]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;evoamphib&quot; /&gt; Amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods.

At the end of the Devonian period (360 million years ago), the seas, rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoczynska&quot;/&gt; though some, such as ''Ichthyostega'', may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water.

There were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain, occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile.

The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the [[Paleozoic]] or early [[Mesozoic]] (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=San Mauro, Diego |author2=Vences, Miguel |author3=Alcobendas, Marina |author4=Zardoya, Rafael |author5=Meyer, Axel |year=2005 |title=Initial diversification of living amphibians predated the breakup of Pangaea |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=590–599 |doi=10.1086/429523 |pmid=15795855 |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-33053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are large gaps in the [[fossil record]], but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs.

As they evolved from lunged fish, amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land, including the need to develop new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their [[lateral line]] systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful [[ultraviolet]] rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843–859 }}

Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal [[Physiology|physiological]] processes. Their [[Basal metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully [[Ossification|ossified]] vertebrae with [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, [[Skin|poison glands]] (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the [[Buccopharyngeal membrane|buccopharyngeal]] region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=24–25 }} They supplement this with [[gas exchange]] through the skin.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843–859 }}

Members of this order are [[eel]]-like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs. Some of their features are primitive while others are derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cogger, H. G. |editor=Zweifel, R. G |year=1998 |title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians |publisher= Academic Press |pages= 69–70 |isbn=978-0-12-178560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack [[spermatheca]]e for sperm storage. Despite this, the eggs are laid singly, a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritCaudata&quot; /&gt;

=== Gymnophiona ===
[[File:Siphonops paulensis02.jpg|thumb|alt=''Siphonops paulensis''|The limbless South American caecilian ''[[Siphonops paulensis]]'']]
The order [[Gymnophiona]] (from the Greek ''gymnos'' meaning &quot;naked&quot; and ''ophis'' meaning &quot;serpent&quot;) or Apoda (from the Latin ''an-'' meaning &quot;without&quot; and the Greek ''poda'' meaning &quot;legs&quot;) comprises the caecilians. These are long, cylindrical, limbless animals with a snake- or [[Annelid|worm-like]] form. The adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres (3 to 30 inches) with the exception of [[Caecilia thompsoni|Thomson's caecilian]] (''Caecilia thompsoni''), which can reach {{convert|150|cm|ft|abbr=off}}. A caecilian's skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales. It has rudimentary eyes covered in skin, which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity. It also has a pair of short [[tentacle]]s near the eye that can be extended and which have [[Somatosensory system|tactile]] and [[Olfaction|olfactory]] functions. Most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil, in rotten wood and under plant debris, but some are aquatic.{{sfn| Stebbins| Cohen | 1995 | p=4}} Most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch, they make their way to adjacent bodies of water. Others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch. A few species give birth to live young, nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=858}} Caecilians have a mostly [[Gondwana]]n distribution, being found in tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Central and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29797/Gymnophiona |title=Gymnophiona |author=Duellman, William E. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomy and physiology ==

=== Skin ===
[[File:Tree frog congo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Common reed frog|The [[Aposematism|bright colours]] of the [[common reed frog]] (''Hyperolius viridiflavus'') are typical of a toxic species]]
The [[Wikt:integument|integumentary]] structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates, such as the presence of highly [[Keratin#Cornification|cornified]] outer layers, renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the [[pituitary gland|pituitary]] and [[thyroid]] glands. Local thickenings (often called warts) are common, such as those found on toads. The outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece, in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes. Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the [[dermis]] between the furrows in the skin. The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial. [[Squamata|Lizards]] and some frogs have somewhat similar [[osteoderm]]s forming bony deposits in the dermis, but this is an example of [[convergent evolution]] with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zylberberg, Louise |author2=Wake, Marvalee H. |year=1990 |title=Structure of the scales of ''Dermophis'' and ''Microcaecilia'' (Amphibia: Gymnophiona), and a comparison to dermal ossifications of other vertebrates |journal=Journal of Morphology |volume=206 |issue=1 |pages=25–43 |doi=10.1002/jmor.1052060104 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227806326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amphibian skin is permeable to water. Gas exchange can take place through the skin ([[cutaneous respiration]]) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;amphibfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Amphibian_morphology_and_reproduction |title=Amphibian morphology and reproduction |date=October 12, 2008 |authors=Biodiversity Institute of Ontario; Hebert, Paul D. N. |work=Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main poison-producing glands, the [[Parotoid gland|paratoids]], produce the neurotoxin [[bufotoxin]] and are located behind the ears of toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=10–11 }}

The skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called [[chromatophore]]s. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by [[hormone]]s secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Integument: A Textbook of Skin Biology |last=Spearman |first=R.

=== Skeletal system and locomotion ===
Amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to other tetrapods, though with a number of variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully [[ossification|ossified]] and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The [[pectoral girdle]] is supported by muscle, and the well-developed [[pelvic girdle]] is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }}

[[File:Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton front.jpg|thumb|alt=Frog skeleton|Skeleton of the [[Surinam horned frog]]&lt;br&gt;(''Ceratophrys cornuta'')]]
In most amphibians, there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some salamanders have fewer digits and the [[amphiuma]]s are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The [[Siren (genus)|sirens]] are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26–36 }}

In frogs, the hind legs are larger than the fore legs, especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} Some salamanders in the genus ''[[Aneides]]'' and certain [[lungless salamander|plethodontids]] climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritCaudata&quot; /&gt; In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[ventral fin|ventral]] fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26–36 }}

Salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as [[autotomy]]. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beneski&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Beneski, John T. Jr. | date=September 1989 | title=Adaptive significance of tail autotomy in the salamander, ''Ensatina'' | journal=Journal of Herpetology | volume=23 | issue=3 | pages=322–324 | doi=10.2307/1564465 | jstor=1564465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26–36 }}

=== Circulatory system ===
[[File:Didactic model of a amphibian heart-FMVZ USP-14.jpeg|thumb|left|200x200px|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of an amphibian heart.]]
[[File:Juvenile Amphibian Circulatory System.svg|thumb|Juvenile amphibian circulatory systems are single loop systems which resemble fish.&lt;br&gt; 1 – Internal gills where the blood is reoxygenated&lt;br&gt;2 – Point where the blood is depleted of oxygen and returns to the heart via veins&lt;br&gt;3 – Two chambered heart.&lt;br&gt;Red indicates oxygenated blood, and blue represents oxygen depleted blood.]]
Amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation is similar to that of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the [[pulmonary artery]] to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=306 }}

=== Nervous and sensory systems ===
The [[nervous system]] is basically the same as in other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish. It is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving [[Pain in amphibians|pain]].  The brain consists of equal parts, [[cerebrum]], [[midbrain]] and [[cerebellum]]. Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning. The cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the [[medulla oblongata]] controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body. The [[pineal body]], known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in [[hibernation]] and [[aestivation]] in amphibians.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=100 }}

Tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]] that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular [[Tympanum (anatomy)|eardrum]] lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the [[stapes]], to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} There is a patch of specialized haircells, called ''papilla amphibiorum'', in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=69 }} The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAmphibia&quot; /&gt;

The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, the [[cornea]] becomes more dome-shaped, the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] becomes flatter, and [[eyelid]]s and associated glands and ducts develop.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAmphibia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/21445/amphibian/ |title=Amphibian |author1=Duellman, William E. |author2=Zug, George R. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digestive and excretory systems ===
[[File:Frog anatomy tags.PNG|thumb|alt=Dissected frog|Dissected frog: 1&amp;nbsp;Right&amp;nbsp;atrium, 2&amp;nbsp;Liver, 3&amp;nbsp;Aorta, 4&amp;nbsp;Egg mass, 5&amp;nbsp;Colon, 6&amp;nbsp;Left&amp;nbsp;atrium, 7&amp;nbsp;Ventricle, 8&amp;nbsp;Stomach, 9&amp;nbsp;Left lung, 10&amp;nbsp;Gallbladder, 11&amp;nbsp;Small&amp;nbsp;intestine, 12&amp;nbsp;Cloaca]]
Many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by [[inertia]]. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short [[Esophagus|oesophagus]] is lined with [[Cilium|cilia]] that help to move the food to the stomach and [[mucus]] produced by glands in the mouth and [[pharynx]] eases its passage. The enzyme [[chitinase]] produced in the stomach helps digest the [[chitin]]ous cuticle of arthropod prey.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}

Amphibians possess a [[pancreas]], [[liver]] and [[gall bladder]]. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is determined by its function as a [[glycogen]] and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. [[Adipose tissue]] is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=66 }}
&lt;!--In aquatic amphibians, the liver plays only a small role in processing nitrogen for excretion, and [[ammonia]] is diffused mainly through the skin. The liver of terrestrial amphibians converts ammonia to urea, a less toxic, water-soluble nitrogenous compound, as a means of water conservation. In some species, urea is further converted into [[uric acid]]. [[Bile]] secretions from the liver collect in the gall bladder and flow into the small intestine. In the small intestine, enzymes digest carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Salamanders lack a valve separating the small intestine from the large intestine. Salt and water absorption occur in the large intestine, as well as mucous secretion to aid in the transport of faecal matter, which is passed out through the [[cloaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Anatomy&quot; /&gt;---Omitting this until a more reliable source can be found.---&gt;

There are two [[kidney]]s located dorsally, near the roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=849 }}

=== Respiratory system ===
[[File:Axolotl ganz.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Axolotl|The [[axolotl]] (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') retains its larval form with gills into adulthood]]
The lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes, possessing few internal [[alveolar septum|septa]] and large [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by [[buccal pumping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brainerd|first1=E. L. |title=New perspectives on the evolution of lung ventilation mechanisms in vertebrates |journal=Experimental Biology Online |year=1999 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1007/s00898-999-0002-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient [[cutaneous respiration]], the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }} Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the [[Telmatobius culeus|Titicaca water frog]] and the [[Cryptobranchus|hellbender salamander]]. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the [[Plethodontidae|plethodontid salamanders]], which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the [[axolotl]]) retaining gills as aquatic adults.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}

== Reproduction ==
{{see also|Sexual selection in amphibians}}
[[File:Litoria xanthomera amplexus.jpg|thumb|alt=Orange-thighed frogs in amplexus|Male [[orange-thighed frog]] (''Litoria xanthomera'') grasping the female during [[amplexus]]]]
For the purpose of [[Biological reproduction|reproduction]] most amphibians require [[fresh water]] although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. ''[[Fejervarya raja]]'') can inhabit brackish water, but there are no true [[marine (ocean)|marine]] amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hopkins Gareth R. |author2=Brodie Edmund D., Jr | year = 2015 | title = Occurrence of Amphibians in Saline Habitats: A Review and Evolutionary Perspective | url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1655/HERPMONOGRAPHS-D-14-00006 | journal = Herpetological Monographs | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 1–27 | doi = 10.1655/HERPMONOGRAPHS-D-14-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such was the case with the [[Black Sea]] invasion of the natural hybrid ''[[Pelophylax esculentus]]'' reported in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Natchev, Nikolay |author2=Tzankov, Nikolay |author3=Geme, Richard |year=2011 |title=Green frog invasion in the Black Sea: habitat ecology of the ''Pelophylax esculentus'' complex (Anura, Amphibia) population in the region of Shablenska Тuzla lagoon in Bulgaria |journal=Herpetology Notes |volume=4 |pages=347–351 |url=http://www.herpetologynotes.seh-herpetology.org/Volume4_PDFs/Natchev_et_al_Herpetology_Notes_Volume4_pages347-351.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several hundred frog species in [[adaptive radiation]]s (e.g., ''[[Eleutherodactylus]]'', the Pacific ''[[Platymantis]]'', the Australo-Papuan [[microhylid]]s, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water for [[breeding in the wild]]. They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforests]] and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the [[tadpole]] stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |author=Hogan, C. Michael |date=July 31, 2010 |work=Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |accessdate=September 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608071757/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |archivedate=June 8, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tropics, many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=140–141 }}

In caecilians, fertilisation is internal, the male extruding an [[intromittent organ]], the phallodeum, and inserting it into the female cloaca. The paired Müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian [[prostate]] glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duellman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman|first=Willia E. |author2= Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=77–79 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=phallodeum#v=onepage&amp;q=phallodeum&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone, on the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called [[amplexus]]. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, [[Hynobiidae]] and [[Cryptobranchidae]] practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duellman&quot; /&gt;

With a few exceptions, frogs use external fertilisation. The male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs, or in the case of ''[[Epipedobates tricolor]]'', around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the [[granular poison frog]] (''Oophaga granulifera'') where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The [[tailed frog]] (''Ascaphus truei'') exhibits internal fertilisation. The &quot;tail&quot; is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154–162 }} The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the [[oviduct]] until the following spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ascaphus&amp;where-species=truei |title=''Ascaphus truei'' |author1=Adams, Michael J. |author2=Pearl, Christopher A. |year=2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders. Typically, prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site, the males usually arriving first, calling and setting up territories. Other satellite males remain quietly nearby, waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory. The females arrive sporadically, mate selection takes place and eggs are laid. The females depart and territories may change hands. More females appear and in due course, the breeding season comes to an end. Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall. These frogs are typically [[wikt:fossorial|fossorial]] species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site. They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place, perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season. The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues, the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154–162 }}

[[File:Plethodon cinereus.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Sexual selection has been studied in the [[red back salamander]]]]
&lt;!--[[Sexual selection]] typically manifests as male-male competition where males will arrive at the waters edge first in large number, producing a wide range of vocalizations and other complex behaviours to attract mates, with the [[fitness (biology)|fittest]] males having the deepest croaks and the best territories. It also exists as [[mate choice]], with females known to choose a mate, at least partly based on the male's depth of croaking. This has led to [[sexual dimorphism]], with females being larger than males in 90% of species, males larger in 10% of species and males fighting for groups of females.--&gt;

== Life cycle ==
Most amphibians go through [[metamorphosis]], a process of significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by [[thyroxine]] concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and [[prolactin]], which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Kikuyama | first1 = Sakae

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called [[apoptosis]]. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Newman, Robert A. |year=1992 |title=Adaptive plasticity in amphibian metamorphosis |journal=BioScience |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=671–678 |doi= 10.2307/1312173 |jstor=1312173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eggs ===
[[File:Frogspawn closeup.jpg|thumb|alt=Frogspawn|Frogspawn, a mass of eggs surrounded by jelly]]

The egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing [[mucoprotein]]s and [[mucopolysaccharide]]s. This capsule is permeable to water and gases, and swells considerably as it absorbs water. The ovum is at first rigidly held, but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the [[embryo]] to move freely. This also happens in salamander eggs, even when they are unfertilised. Eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae. These penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis. They seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilbert, Perry W. |year=1942 |title=Observations on the eggs of ''Ambystoma maculatum'' with especial reference to the green algae found within the egg envelopes |journal=Ecology |volume=23 |pages=215–227 |jstor=1931088 |doi=10.2307/1931088 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most eggs contain the pigment [[melanin]] which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against [[ultraviolet radiation]]. Caecilians, some [[plethodontid]] salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented. In the [[wood frog]] (''Rana sylvatica''), the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to {{convert|6|C-change|F-change}} warmer than its surroundings, which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Waldman, Bruce |author2=Ryan, Michael J. |year=1983 |title=Thermal advantages of communal egg mass deposition in wood frogs (''Rana sylvatica'') |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=70–72 |jstor=1563783 |doi=10.2307/1563783|url=https://www.academia.edu/14057397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups, or may take the form of spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander ''[[Ensatina]]'' attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The [[Eleutherodactylus planirostris|greenhouse frog]] (''Eleutherodactylus planirostris'') lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&amp;where-genus=Eleutherodactylus&amp;where-species=planirostris |title=''Eleutherodactylus planirostris'' |author=Meshaka, Walter E. Jr |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tungara frog]] (''Physalaemus pustulosus'') builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties.

=== Larvae ===
[[File:Frog spawn time-lapse.gif|thumb|left|alt=Frog spawn development|Early stages in the development of the embryos of the [[common frog]] (''Rana temporaria'')]]
The eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free-living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults. In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), direct development takes place, the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults. Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land, and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies. Some caecilians, the [[alpine salamander]] (''Salamandra atra'') and some of the [[Nectophrynoides|African live-bearing toads]] (''Nectophrynoides spp.'') are [[Vivipary|viviparous]]. Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female's oviduct, often for long periods. Other amphibians, but not caecilians, are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]]. The eggs are retained in or on the parent's body, but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult. The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth, either before or after metamorphosis, according to their species.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=6–9 }} The toad genus ''Nectophrynoides'' exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members.&lt;ref name=&quot;species&quot;/&gt;

==== Frogs ====
Frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. The free-living larvae are normally fully aquatic, but the tadpoles of some species (such as ''[[Nannophrys ceylonensis]]'') are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_lists_genera_&amp;table=amphib&amp;where-genus=Nannophrys&amp;where-species=ceylonensis |title=''Nannophrys ceylonensis'' |author=Janzen, Peter |date=May 10, 2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), [[lateral line system]]s and large tails that they use for swimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-40603/Anura |title=Anura: From tadpole to adult |author1=Duellman, W. E. |author2=Zug, G. R. |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills. The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. These larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place. While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=179–181 }} Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.

[[File:Amphibian Metamorphosis.PNG|thumb|Amphibian metamorphosis]]
Iodine and T4 (over stimulate the spectacular [[apoptosis]] [programmed cell death] of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins) also stimulate the [[evolution of nervous systems]] transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, visuospatial, olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology-|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|issn=1872-3136|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272210714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Iodine, PUFAs and Iodolipids in Health and Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective|journal=Human Evolution-|volume= 29 |issue= 1–3|pages=185–205|year=2014|issn=0393-9375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically [[herbivore|herbivorous]]. Pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies, large caudal fins and small mouths; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation. Stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths, shallow bodies and caudal fins; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of [[algae]] and bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAnura&quot;/&gt; They also feed on [[diatom]]s, filtered from the water through the [[gill]]s, and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond, ingesting edible fragments. They have a relatively long, spiral-shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAnura&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29023/Anura |title=Anura |author1=Duellman, William E. |author2=Zug, George R. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles and fish. Young of the [[Cuban tree frog]] (''Osteopilus septentrionalis'') can occasionally be [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalistic]], the younger tadpoles attacking a larger, more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crump, Martha L. |year=1986 |title=Cannibalism by younger tadpoles: another hazard of metamorphosis |journal=Copeia |volume=4 |pages=1007–1009 |jstor=1445301 |doi=10.2307/1445301 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Bufobufotadpoles.jpg|800px|alt=Metamorphosis|Successive stages in the development of [[common toad]] (''Bufo bufo'') tadpoles, finishing with metamorphosis}}
At metamorphosis, rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large jaw, and its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.&lt;ref name=&quot;EBAnura&quot; /&gt;

==== Salamanders ====
[[File:Ambystoma macrodactylum 26597.JPG|thumb|alt=Larva of the long-toed salamander|Larva of the [[long-toed salamander]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ambystoma macrodactylum'')]]
[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg|thumb|alt=Larvae of the alpine newt|Larvae of the [[alpine newt]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ichthyosaura alpestris'')]]
At hatching, a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both upper and lower jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera ''[[Ambystoma]]'' and ''[[Dicamptodon]]'' have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The [[northwestern salamander]] (''Ambystoma gracile'') is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as [[neoteny]], or transforms into an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Valentine, Barry D. |author2=Dennis, David M. | year=1964 | title=A comparison of the gill-arch system and fins of three genera of larval salamanders, ''Rhyacotriton'', ''Gyrinophilus'', and ''Ambystoma'' | journal=Copeia | volume=1964 | issue=1 | pages=196–201 | jstor=1440850 | doi=10.2307/1440850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are able to breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Ambystoma&amp;where-species=gracile |title=''Ambystoma gracile'' |author=Shaffer, H. Bradley |year=2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/titus/herp_old/neoteny.htm |title=Metamorphosis vs. neoteny (paedomorphosis) in salamanders (Caudata) |author=Kiyonaga, Robin R |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from [[conspecific]]s. The [[tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma tigrinum'') also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out. There are fifteen species of [[wikt:obligate|obligate]] neotenic salamanders, including species of ''[[Necturus]]'', ''[[Olm|Proteus]]'' and ''Amphiuma'', and many examples of [[wikt:facultative|facultative]] ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman |first=William E. |author2=Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=191–192 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=salamander+obligate+neoteny#v=onepage&amp;q=salamander%20obligate%20neoteny&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus ''[[Ensatinas]]'', the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=196 }}

In newts and salamanders, metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs. This is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shaffer, H. Bradley |author2=Austin, C. C. |author3=Huey, R. B. |year=1991 |title=The consequences of metamorphosis on salamander (''Ambystoma'') locomotor performance |journal=Physiological Zoology |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=212–231 |jstor=30158520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100353/Caudata |title=Caudata |author=Wake, David B. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caecilians ====
[[File:CaecilianNHM.png|thumb|left|alt=''Ichthyophis glutinosus''|The caecilian ''Ichthyophis glutinosus'' with eggs and developing embryo]]
Most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water. The development of the young of ''[[Ichthyophis glutinosus]]'', a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied. The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water. They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes, a lateral line system and a short tail with fins. They swim by undulating their body from side to side. They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land. Metamorphosis is gradual. By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails. The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments. By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Breckenridge, W. R. |author2=Nathanael, S. |author3=Pereira, L. |year=1987 |title=Some aspects of the biology and development of ''Ichthyophis glutinosus'' |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=211 |pages=437–449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siphonops annulatus.jpg|thumb|alt=Ringed caecilian|The [[Siphonops annulatus|ringed caecilian]] (''Siphonops annulatus'') resembles an earthworm]]
In the majority of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. ''[[Typhlonectes compressicauda]]'', a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in [[lipid]]s and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as long as their mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wake, Marvalee H. |year=1977 |title=Fetal maintenance and its evolutionary significance in the Amphibia: Gymnophiona |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=379–386 |jstor=1562719 |doi=10.2307/1562719 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265101247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29797/Gymnophiona |title=Gymnophiona |author=Duellman, William E. |year=2012 |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ringed caecilian (''[[Siphonops annulatus]]'') has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction. The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile, they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wilkinson, Mark |author2=Kupfer, Alexander |author3=Marques-Porto, Rafael |author4=Jeffkins, Hilary |author5=Antoniazzi, Marta M. |author6=Jared, Carlos |year=2008 |title= One hundred million years of skin feeding?

=== Parental care ===
[[File:Panama Poison Dart Frog Colostethus panamensis with tadpoles.jpg|thumb|alt=Common rocket frog|Male [[common rocket frog]] (''Colostethus panamensis'') carrying tadpoles on his back]]

The care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, it is estimated that in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crump| first=Martha L.| year=1996| title=Parental care among the Amphibia| journal=Advances in the Study of Behavior| volume=25| pages=109–144| doi=10.1016/S0065-3454(08)60331-9 | series=Advances in the Study of Behavior| isbn=978-0-12-004525-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1086/650727 | last1=Brown | first1=J.

Many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The [[black mountain salamander]] (''Desmognathus welteri'') does this, the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=853–854 }} The male hellbender, a primitive salamander, excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.&lt;ref name=&quot;EHSAR&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Alytes obstetricans almogavarii - male with eggs 2.jpg|thumb|left|Male [[common midwife toad]] (''Alytes obstetricans'') carrying eggs]]
The male ''[[Colostethus subpunctatus]]'', a tiny frog, protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log.

== Feeding and diet ==
[[File:Pacific brown salamander eating a worm.jpg|thumb|alt=Northwestern salamander|[[Northwestern salamander]] &lt;br&gt;(''Ambystoma gracile'') eating a worm]]
With a few exceptions, adult amphibians are [[Predation|predators]], feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow. The diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles, caterpillars, earthworms and spiders. The sirens (''[[Siren (genus)|Siren spp.]]'') often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Siren_intermedia.html |title=''Siren intermedia'': Lesser Siren |author=Gabbard, Jesse |year=2000 |work=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Brazilian tree frog (''[[Xenohyla truncata]]'') includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Da Silva, H. R. |author2=De Britto-Pereira, M. C. |year=2006 |title=How much fruit do fruit-eating frogs eat?

It projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first, their tongues being hinged at the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Trueb, Linda |author2=Gans, Carl |year=1983 |title=Feeding specializations of the Mexican burrowing toad, ''Rhinophrynus dorsalis'' (Anura: Rhinophrynidae) |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=199 |issue=2 |pages=189–208 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1983.tb02090.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food is mostly selected by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and [[Rana clamitans|green frogs]] (''Rana clamitans'') have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hamilton, W. J. Jr. |year=1948 |title=The food and feeding behavior of the green frog, ''Rana clamitans'' Latreille, in New York State |journal=Copeia |volume=1948 |issue=3 |pages=203–207 |publisher=American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists |jstor=1438455 |doi=10.2307/1438455 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=56 }}

Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; They typically have small hinged [[pedicellate teeth]], a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown of these are composed of [[dentine]] separated by an [[Calcification|uncalcified]] layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (''Rana spp.'') lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (''Bufo spp.'') have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also [[vomerine teeth]] attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=57–58 }}

The [[tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma tigrinum'') is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the ''Bufo spp.'' toads, actively search for prey, while the [[Argentine horned frog]] (''Ceratophrys ornata'') lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Radcliffe, Charles W. |author2=Chiszar, David |author3=Estep, Karen |author4=Murphy, James B. |author5=Smith, Hobart M. |year=1986 |title=Observations on pedal luring and pedal movements in Leptodactylid frogs |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=300–306 |jstor=1564496 |doi=10.2307/1564496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Toft, Catherine A. |year=1981 |title=Feeding ecology of Panamanian litter anurans: patterns in diet and foraging mode |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=139–144 |jstor=1563372 |doi=10.2307/1563372 |url=https://www.academia.edu/364846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bemis, W. E. |author2=Schwenk, K. |author3=Wake, M.

When they are newly hatched, frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg. When this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually at the bottom of their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=181–185 }}

== Vocalization ==
[[File:Dendropsophus microcephalus - calling male (Cope, 1886).jpg|thumb|alt=Male treefrog calling|Male treefrog (''[[Dendropsophus microcephalus]]'') inflating his air sac as he calls]]
The calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the [[California giant salamander]] (''Dicamptodon ensatus'') has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=76–77 }}

[[File:American Toad singing.jpg|thumb|American toad, (''[[Anaxyrus americanus]]'') singing]]
Frogs are much more vocal, especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an [[Gular skin|air sac]] or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=76–77 }} The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sullivan, Brian K. |year=1992 |title=Sexual selection and calling behavior in the American toad (''Bufo americanus'') |journal=Copeia |volume=1992 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |jstor=1446530 |doi=10.2307/1446530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |chapter=Capitulo 4 |title=When frogs scream!

F. B. |year=2007 |publisher=Instituto de Biociências, São Paulo }}&lt;/ref&gt; The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (''Osteopilus septentrionalis'') produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw259 |title=The Cuban Treefrog (''Osteopilus septentrionalis'') in Florida |author=Johnson, Steve A. |year=2010 |work=EDIS |publisher=University of Florida |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Territorial behaviour ==
Little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shine, Richard |year=1979 |title=Sexual selection and sexual dimorphism in the Amphibia |journal=Copeia |volume=1979 |issue=2 |pages=297–306 |jstor=1443418 |doi=10.2307/1443418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Redback salamander.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Red-backed salamander|The red back salamander (''[[Plethodon cinereus]]'') defends a territory against intruders.]]
In salamanders, defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder. This may involve snapping, chasing and sometimes biting, occasionally causing the loss of a tail. The behaviour of [[red back salamander]]s (''Plethodon cinereus'') has been much studied. 91% of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre (yard) of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gergits, W. F. |author2=Jaeger, R. G. | year=1990 | title=Site attachment by the red-backed salamander, ''Plethodon cinereus'' | journal=Journal of Herpetology | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=91–93 | jstor=1564297 | doi=10.2307/1564297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar proportion, when moved experimentally a distance of {{convert|30|m}}, found their way back to their home base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot;/&gt; The salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged {{convert|0.16|to|0.33|m2}} in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&amp;where-genus=Plethodon&amp;where-species=cinereus&amp;rel-genus=equals&amp;rel-species=equals|title=''Plethodon cinereus'' |author=Casper, Gary S |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas. Much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals. An aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively. If the intruder persisted, a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves. Damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival, either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gergits&quot; /&gt;

In frogs, male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a &quot;home advantage&quot; and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place. Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wells, K. D. | year=1977 | title=Territoriality and male mating success in the green frog (''Rana clamitans'') | journal=Ecology | volume=58 | issue=4 | pages=750–762 | jstor=1936211 | doi=10.2307/1936211 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defence mechanisms ==
[[File:Adult Cane toad.jpg|thumb|alt=Cane toad|[[Cane toad]] (''Rhinella marina'') with poison glands behind the eyes]]

Amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins, and lack claws, defensive armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barthalmus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Barthalmus, G. T. |author2=Zielinski W. J. |year=1988 |title=''Xenopus'' skin mucus induces oral dyskinesias that promote escape from snakes |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry Behavior |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=957–959 |pmid=3227042 |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(88)90126-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow [[African clawed frog]]s (''Xenopus laevis''), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barthalmus&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Xenopus&amp;where-species=laevis |title=Xenopus laevis | author = Crayon, John J | publisher=AmphibiaWeb | accessdate=October 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (''Typhlonectes compressicauda'') produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moodie, G.

The [[rough-skinned newt]] (''Taricha granulosa'') from North America and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin [[tetrodotoxin]] (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by [[pufferfish]]. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Brodie, Edmund D.

[[File:Salamander-olympus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Fire salamander|The [[fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra''), a toxic species, wears warning colours.]]

Poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black, with the [[fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'') being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the [[fire-bellied toad]] (''Bombina spp.''), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog ''[[Allobates zaparo]]'' is not poisonous, but [[Batesian mimicry|mimics]] the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Darst, Catherine R. |author2=Cummings, Molly E. |date=9 March 2006 |title=Predator learning favours mimicry of a less-toxic model in poison frogs |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=208–211 |doi=10.1038/nature04297 |issue=7081 |pmid=16525472 |bibcode=2006Natur.440..208D |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day, thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight. Other amphibians use [[camouflage]] to avoid being detected. They have various colourings such as mottled browns, greys and olives to blend into the background. Some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the North American [[northern short-tailed shrew]] (''Blarina brevicauda''). Their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison-producing granular glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brodie, Edmund D. Jr. |author2=Nowak, Robert T. |author3=Harvey, William R. |year=1979 |title=Antipredator secretions and behavior of selected salamanders against shrews |journal=Copeia |volume=1979 |issue=2 |pages=270–274 |jstor=1443413 |doi=10.2307/1443413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked, sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape. The tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached. The tail is regenerated later, but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beneski&quot; /&gt;
Some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce, and some spadefoot toads (''[[Pelobates]] spp'') scream and leap towards the attacker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot; /&gt; Giant salamanders of the genus ''[[Andrias]]'', as well as [[Ceratophryinae|Ceratophrine]] and ''[[Pyxicephalus]]'' frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite. The [[blackbelly salamander]] (''Desmognathus quadramaculatus'') can bite an attacking common garter snake (''Thamnophis sirtalis'') two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brodie, E.

== Cognition ==
In amphibians, there is evidence of [[habituation]], [[associative learning]] through both [[Classical conditioning|classical]] and [[instrumental learning]], and discrimination abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hloch, A.|year=2010|title=What Does a Salamander Remember After Winter?|publisher=University of Vienna.

In one experiment, when offered live fruit flies (''[[Drosophila]] virilis''), salamanders choose the larger of 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3. Frogs can distinguish between low numbers (1 vs 2, 2 vs 3, but not 3 vs 4) and large numbers (3 vs 6, 4 vs 8, but not 4 vs 6) of prey. This is irrespective of other characteristics, i.e. surface area, volume, weight and movement, although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stancher&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stancher, G., Rugani, R., Regolin, L. and Vallortigara, G.|year=2015|title=Numerical discrimination by frogs (Bombina orientalis)|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=18|issue=1|pages=219–229|doi=10.1007/s10071-014-0791-7|url=https://www.academia.edu/12580390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bufo periglenes1.jpg|thumb|alt=Golden toad|The extinct [[golden toad]] (''Bufo periglenes''), last seen in 1989]]
Dramatic declines in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized [[extinction]], have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world, and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCallum |first1=M.

Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://app.databasin.org/app/pages/datasetPage.jsp?id=461e58214aa54ad79382066ab829c05f |title=Number of Globally Threatened Amphibian Species by Freshwater Ecoregion |author1=Hoekstra, J.

However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amphibians.org/ |title=Amphibian Specialist Group |publisher=IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often considered to be [[ecological indicator]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waddle&quot;&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |chapter= |title=Use of amphibians as ecosystem indicator species |url=http://etd.fcla.edu/UF/UFE0016760/waddle_j.pdf |last=Waddle |first=James Hardin |year=2006 |publisher=University of Florida }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species. In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in [[mosquito]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Regier| first1 = Henry A.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The [[western terrestrial garter snake]] (''Thamnophis elegans'') in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the [[Yosemite toad]] (''Bufo canorus'') and the [[mountain yellow-legged frog]] (''Rana muscosa''), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jennings, W.

These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on [[detritus]] that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=249 }}

A [[global strategy]] to stem the crisis was released in 2005 in the form of the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmphibianArk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/asia/regional_activities/asian_amphibian_crisis/taking_action/amphibian_conservation_action_plan/ |title=Amphibian Conservation Action Plan |work=IUCN |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427134336/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/asia/regional_activities/asian_amphibian_crisis/taking_action/amphibian_conservation_action_plan/ |archivedate=April 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amphibian Ark]] is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmphibianArk&quot; /&gt; One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amphibianrescue.org/?page_id=91 |title=Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project |publisher=Amphibian Ark |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alaska''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alaska.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|æ|s|k|ə}}) is a [[U.S. state]] located in the northwest extremity of [[North America]]. The [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian administrative divisions]] of [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]] border the state to the east, its most extreme western part is [[Attu Island]], and it has a maritime border with [[Russia]] to the west across the [[Bering Strait]]. To the north are the [[Chukchi Sea|Chukchi]] and [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] seas–the southern parts of the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The [[Pacific Ocean]] lies to the south and southwest. It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|largest state]] in the [[United States]] by area and the 
[[List of country subdivisions by area|seventh largest subnational division in the world]]. In addition, it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|3rd least populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|most sparsely populated]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]; nevertheless, it is by far the most populous territory located mostly north of the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]] in North America, its population (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015&lt;ref name=PopEstUS/&gt;) more than quadrupling the combined populations of [[Northern Canada]] and [[Greenland]]. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]]. Alaska's economy is dominated by the [[fishing]], [[natural gas]], and [[petroleum|oil]] industries, resources which it has in abundance. [[United States Armed Forces|Military]] bases and tourism are also a significant part of the [[Economy of Alaska|economy]].

The United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]] from the [[Russian Empire]] on March 30, 1867, for 7.2&amp;nbsp;million U.S. dollars at approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[Territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| year =1959| title =Video: 49th Star.

The name &quot;Alaska&quot; ({{lang-rus|Аляска|r=Alyaska}}) was introduced in the [[Russian America|Russian colonial period]] when it was used to refer to the [[Alaska Peninsula|peninsula]]. It was derived from an [[Aleut language|Aleut]], or [[Unangam]] [[idiom]], which figuratively refers to the mainland of Alaska. Literally, it means ''object to which the action of the sea is directed''.&lt;ref name=Aleut&gt;{{cite book|title=Aleut Dictionary: Unangam Tunudgusii|author=Bergsland, Knut (ed.)|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center|year=1994|isbn=1-55500-047-9}}, at pp. 49 (Alaxsxi-x = mainland Alaska), 50 (''alagu-x'' = ''sea''), 508 (''-gi'' = suffix, ''object of its action'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bright&gt;{{cite book|title=Native American Placenames in the United States|author=Bright, William|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0806135984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, J. Ellis. 1940. &quot;Derivation of the Word &quot;Alaska&quot;, &quot; ''American Anthropologist'' n.s., 42: pp. 550–551&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main article|Geography of Alaska}}
Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States and has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the [[Aleutian Islands]] extend into the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. Alaska is the only non-[[contiguous]] U.S. state on continental North America; about {{convert|500|mi|km|-1}} of [[British Columbia]] (Canada) separates Alaska from [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is technically part of the [[Continental United States|continental U.S.]], but is sometimes not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]], often called [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;the Lower 48&quot;]]. The capital city, [[Juneau]], is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.

The state is bordered by [[Yukon]] and [[British Columbia]] in Canada, to the east, the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south and southwest, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west and the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian [[Big Diomede Island]] and Alaskan [[Little Diomede Island]] are only {{convert|3|mi|km}} apart. Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF14/1404.html |title=Alaska's Size in Perspective |accessdate=November 19, 2007 |author=Benson, Carl |date=September 2, 1998 |publisher=[[Geophysical Institute]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125211706/http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF14/1404.html |archivedate=November 25, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alaska area compared to conterminous US.svg|thumb|Alaska's size compared with the [[contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]]. ([[Albers projection|Albers equal-area conic projection]])]]

Alaska is the largest state in the United States by total area at {{convert|663,268|sqmi|km2|0}}, over twice the size of [[Texas]], the next largest state. Alaska is larger than all but 18 sovereign countries. Counting territorial waters, Alaska is larger than the combined area of the next three largest states: Texas, [[California]], and [[Montana]]. It is also larger than the combined area of the 22 smallest U.S. states.

===Regions===
There are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are six widely accepted regions:

====South Central====
{{main article|South Central Alaska}}
The most populous region of Alaska, containing [[Anchorage]], the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] and the [[Kenai Peninsula]]. Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the [[Alaska Range]] and west of the [[Wrangell Mountains]] also fall within the definition of South Central, as do the [[Prince William Sound]] area and the communities of [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]] and [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].&lt;ref name = cities&gt;{{cite web
|title = Travel Information on South Central Alaska
|year = 2006
|url = http://www.welcometoalaska.com/SouthCentral.htm
|accessdate = 22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southeast====
{{main article|Southeast Alaska}}
Also referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States. As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the [[Alaska Purchase]]. The region is dominated by the [[Alexander Archipelago]] as well as the [[Tongass National Forest]], the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital [[Juneau]], the former capital [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], and [[Ketchikan]], at one time Alaska's largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitnews.us/Kiffer/Ketchikan/043007_ketchikan_1927.html |title= 1927: When Ketchikan was the Largest City in Alaska |work=Sitnews US |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alaska Marine Highway]] provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities ([[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOT Document&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities |publisher= Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities |url= http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/doc/presskit.pdf |title= The Alaska Marine Highway System |access-date=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially designated in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Alaska Channel |work= Alaska.org |publisher= Alaska Channel |url= http://alaska.org/gettingaround/alaska-marine-highway.htm |title= Alaska Marine Highway |access-date=April 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interior====
{{main article|Alaska Interior}}
[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|[[Denali]] is the highest peak in North America.]]
The Interior is the largest region of Alaska; much of it is uninhabited wilderness. [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] is the only large city in the region. [[Denali National Park and Preserve]] is located here. ''[[Denali]]'' is the highest [[mountain]] in North America.

====Southwest====
{{main article|Southwest Alaska}}
[[File:Grizzly Bear Fishing Brooks Falls.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Grizzly bear]] fishing for [[salmon]] at [[Brooks Falls]], part of [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]].]]

Southwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some {{convert|500|mi|km}} inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. [[Kodiak Island]] is also located in Southwest. The massive [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta]], one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here. Portions of the [[Alaska Peninsula]] are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).

====North Slope====
{{main article|Alaska North Slope}}
The North Slope is mostly [[tundra]] peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the [[National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska]] and the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alaska.com |url=http://www.alaska.com/regions/ |title=Alaska.com |publisher=Alaska.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603064023/http://www.alaska.com/regions/ |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], the northernmost city in the United States, is located here. The [[Northwest Arctic Borough, Alaska|Northwest Arctic area]], anchored by [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]] and also containing the [[Kobuk River]] valley, is often regarded as being part of this region. However, the respective [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}.

====Aleutian Islands====
{{main article|Aleutian Islands}}
More than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over {{convert|1200|mi}} into the Pacific Ocean. Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, but the [[International Date Line]] was drawn west of [[180th meridian|180°]] to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day. Two of the islands, [[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]], were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.

===Natural features===
{{see also|Wildlife of Alaska}}
[[File:Augustine Volcano Jan 12 2006 edited-1.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine Volcano]] erupting on January 12, 2006]]

With its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly {{convert|34000|mi|km|-1}} of tidal shoreline. The [[Aleutian Islands]] chain extends west from the southern tip of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. Many active [[volcano]]es are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. [[Unimak Island]], for example, is home to [[Mount Shishaldin]], which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to {{convert|10000|ft|m|0}} above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's [[Mount Fuji]]. The chain of volcanoes extends to [[Mount Spurr]], west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of [[Wrangellia]], a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the [[Pacific Northwest]], which is actively undergoing [[plate tectonics|continent building]].

One of the world's largest tides occurs in [[Turnagain Arm]], just south of Anchorage – tidal differences can be more than {{convert|35|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Porco, Peter|date = June 23, 2003 | title = Long said to be second to Fundy, city tides aren't even close | journal=[[Anchorage Daily News]] | pages = A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|List of lakes in Alaska}}
Alaska has more than three million lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Alaska Hydrology Survey | publisher=Division of Mining, Land, and Water; [[Alaska Department of Natural Resources]] | url=http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/water/hydro/components/surface-water.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marshland]]s and wetland [[permafrost]] cover {{convert|188320|sqmi|km2|0}} (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers some {{convert|16000|sqmi|km2|-1}} of land and {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2|-1}} of tidal zone. The [[Bering Glacier]] complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers {{convert|2250|sqmi|km2|0}} alone. With over 100,000 glaciers, Alaska has half of all in the world.

===Land ownership===
[[File:Public-Lands-Western-US.png|thumb|Alaska has more public land owned by the federal government than any other state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlandfire.com/docs/2007/western-states-data-public-land.htm |title=Western States Data Public Land Acreage |publisher=Wildlandfire.com |date=November 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

According to an October 1998 report by the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]], approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] as public lands, including a multitude of [[United States National Forest|national forests]], national parks, and [[national wildlife refuge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrm.salrm.uaf.edu/~stodd/AlaskaPlanningDirectory/landOwnership.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628125756/http://nrm.salrm.uaf.edu/~stodd/AlaskaPlanningDirectory/landOwnership.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 28, 2002 |title=Alaska Land Ownership |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the [[Bureau of Land Management]] manages {{convert|87|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}, or 23.8% of the state. The [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is managed by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising {{convert|16|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}.

Of the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns {{convert|101|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}}, its entitlement under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]]. A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The [[University of Alaska]], as a [[land grant university]], also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.

Another {{convert|44|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}} are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) of 1971. [[Alaska Native Regional Corporation|Regional Native corporation]] [[Doyon, Limited]] often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. [[Alaska Native Allotment Act|Individual Native allotments]] can be and are sold on the open market, however.

Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state. Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.

===Climate===
{{Main article|Climate of Alaska}}
[[File:AK_koppen.svg|300px|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Alaska.]]
[[File:Alaska climate regions USGS.gif|thumb|Map depicting the climate zones of Alaska.]]

The climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb'') in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfc'') in the northern parts. On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over {{convert|50|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, and [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] averages over {{convert|150|in|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Monthly Climate Summary, Ketchikan, Alaska | publisher= Western Regional Climate Center | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?akketc | accessdate = February 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.

The climate of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] receives {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, with around {{convert|75|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow. It is a subarctic climate ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP D: Continental/microthermal climate|Köppen: ''Dfc'']]) due to its brief, cool summers.

The climate of [[Southwest Alaska|Western Alaska]] is determined in large part by the [[Bering Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This [[region]] has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the [[Kobuk River]] valley (i.&amp;nbsp;e., the region around [[Kotzebue Sound]]) is technically a [[desert]], with portions receiving less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually. On the other extreme, some locations between [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]] and [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] average around {{convert|100|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AK-YK Precip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Mean Annual Precipitation, Alaska-Yukon|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~mabbott1/climate/mark/Images/AK-PPT-mm.gif|work=Spatial Climate Analysis Service|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=June 5, 2012|date=February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of the interior of Alaska is subarctic. Some of the highest and lowest temperatures in Alaska occur around the area near [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]]. The summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °F (the low-to-mid 30s °C), while in the winter, the temperature can fall below {{convert|-60|°F}}. Precipitation is sparse in the Interior, often less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} a year, but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire [[winter]].

The highest and lowest recorded temperatures in Alaska are both in the Interior. The highest is {{convert|100|°F}} in [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] (which is just {{convert|8|mi|km|sp=us|disp=or|abbr=on}} inside the arctic circle) on June 27, 1915,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards Information – Alaska Weather Interesting Facts and Records |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |format=PDF |url=http://www.arh.noaa.gov/docs/AKWXfacts.pdf |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929022606/http://www.arh.noaa.gov/docs/AKWXfacts.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI&gt;{{cite web|title=State Extremes |publisher=Western Regional Climate Center, [[Desert Research Institute]] |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105015744/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/htmlfiles/state.extremes.html |archivedate=January 5, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; making Alaska tied with Hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SD Weather History and Trivia for May: May 1 | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/?n=fsdtrivia05 | accessdate = January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ ALASKA – Frequently Asked Questions About Alaska: Weather |publisher=Statewide Library Electronic Doorway, [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |date=January 17, 2005 |url=http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html#wea |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102180919/http://sled.alaska.edu/akfaq/aksuper.html |archivedate=January 2, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest official Alaska temperature is {{convert|−80|°F}} in [[Prospect Creek, Alaska|Prospect Creek]] on January 23, 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA-All Hazards&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=DRI/&gt; one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental North America (in [[Snag, Yukon|Snag, Yukon, Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ned Rozell |title=The Coldest Place in North America |publisher=Geophysical Institute of the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] |date=January 23, 2003 |url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html |accessdate=January 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202040955/http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF16/1630.html |archivedate=February 2, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate in the extreme north of Alaska is [[polar climate|Arctic]] ([[Köppen climate classification#GROUP E: Polar climates|Köppen: ''ET'']]) with long, very cold winters and short, cool summers. Even in July, the average low temperature in [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]] is {{convert|34|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/PABR/2006/7/23/MonthlyHistory.html History for Barrow, Alaska.

Retrieved October 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Precipitation is light in this part of Alaska, with many places averaging less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} per year, mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year.

===Alaska Natives===
{{main article|Alaska Natives}}
[[File:AlutiiqDancer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A modern [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq]] dancer in traditional festival garb.]]

Numerous indigenous peoples occupied Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/human-journey/ National Geographic. &quot;Atlas of the Human Journey.&quot;  2005. May 2, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tlingit people]] developed a society with a [[matrilineal]] kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the [[Haida people|Haida]], now well known for their unique arts. The [[Tsimshian]] people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President [[Grover Cleveland]], and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on [[Annette Island]] and found the town of [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]]. All three of these peoples, as well as other [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], experienced [[smallpox]] outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating [[epidemics]] occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Brian C. Hosmer, ''American Indians in the Marketplace: Persistence and Innovation among the Menominees and Metlakatlans, 1870–1920'' (Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1999), pp. 129–131, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aleutian Islands are still home to the [[Aleut people]]'s seafaring society, although they were the first Native Alaskans to be exploited by Russians. Western and Southwestern Alaska are home to the [[Yup'ik]], while their cousins the [[Alutiiq people|Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq]] lived in what is now Southcentral Alaska. The [[Gwich'in people]] of the northern Interior region are [[Alaskan Athabaskans|Athabaskan]] and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much-contested [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. The North Slope and [[Little Diomede Island]] are occupied by the widespread [[Inupiat people]].

===Colonization===
{{see also|Russian America}}
[[File:1860-russian-america.jpg|thumb|upright|The Russian America in 1860]]
Some researchers believe that the first Russian settlement in Alaska was established in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Свердлов Л. М. Русское поселение на Аляске в XVII в.? &quot;Природа&quot;. М., 1992. № 4. С.67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, in 1648 several [[Koch (boat)|koches]] of [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]'s expedition came ashore in Alaska by storm and founded this settlement. This hypothesis is based on the testimony of [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] geographer [[Nikolai Daurkin]], who had visited Alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the [[Kheuveren]] River, populated by &quot;bearded men&quot; who &quot;pray to the [[icons]]&quot;. Some modern researchers associate Kheuveren with [[Koyuk River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4877141/ALEXEI-V-POSTNIKOV-nautical-charts-compiled-by-these-promyshlenniki |title=Outline of the History of Russian Cartography |work=Regions: a Prism to View the Slavic Eurasian World |year=2000 |first=Alexey V. |last=Postnikov |authorlink=Alexey Postnikov |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117073034/http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4877141/ALEXEI-V-POSTNIKOV-nautical-charts-compiled-by-these-promyshlenniki |archivedate=January 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European vessel to reach Alaska is generally held to be the ''St. Gabriel'' under the authority of the surveyor [[Mikhail Gvozdev|M. S. Gvozdev]] and assistant navigator [[Ivan Fyodorov (navigator)|I. Fyodorov]] on August 21, 1732, during an expedition of Siberian cossak [[Afanasiy Shestakov|A. F. Shestakov]] and Belorussian explorer [[Dmitry Pavlutsky]] (1729–1735).&lt;ref&gt;Аронов В. Н. Патриарх Камчатского мореходства. // &quot;Вопросы истории рыбной промышленности Камчатки&quot;: Историко-краеведческий сб. – Вып. 3. – 2000. Вахрин С. Покорители великого океана. Петроп.-Камч.: Камштат, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another European contact with Alaska occurred in 1741, when [[Vitus Bering]] led an [[second Kamchatka expedition|expedition]] for the Russian Navy aboard the ''St. Peter''. After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.
[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814.]]

Between 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.

[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.

[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&amp;nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. A federal [[United States territorial court|district court]] was headquartered in Sitka.

For most of Alaska's first decade under the United States flag, Sitka was the only community inhabited by American settlers. They organized a &quot;provisional city government,&quot; which was Alaska's first municipal government, but not in a legal sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Keith|chapter=Learning to cope with 'Seward's Icebox'|title=The Alaskans|year=1977|publisher=[[Time–Life Books]]|location=[[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]]|isbn=0-8094-1506-2|pages=57–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation allowing Alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900, and [[Home rule#Home rule in the United States|home rule]] for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959.

===Territory===
{{see also|Territory of Alaska}}
Starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s, [[Alaska Gold Rush|gold rushes]] in Alaska and the nearby [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska. Alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912. Alaska's capital, which had been in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] until 1906, was moved north to [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. Construction of the [[Alaska Governor's Mansion]] began that same year. European immigrants from Norway and Sweden also settled in southeast Alaska, where they entered the fishing and logging industries.

[[File:US troops at the Battle of Attu.jpg|thumb|U.S. troops navigate snow and ice during the [[Battle of Attu]] in May 1943.]]

During World War II, the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] focused on the three outer Aleutian Islands – [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Agattu]] and [[Kiska Island|Kiska]]&lt;ref&gt;these three Aleutian outer islands are about {{convert|460|mi|km}} away from continental USSR, {{convert|920|mi|km}} from continental Alaska (U.S.), {{convert|950|mi|km}} from Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; – that were invaded by Japanese troops and occupied between June 1942 and August 1943. During the occupation, one Alaskan civilian was killed by Japanese troops and nearly fifty were interned in Japan, where about half of them died. [[Unalaska]]/[[Dutch Harbor]] became a significant base for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[submarine]]rs.

The United States [[Lend-Lease]] program involved the flying of American warplanes through Canada to Fairbanks and then Nome; Soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft, ferrying them to fight the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.

===Statehood===
{{see also|Alaska Statehood Act}}
Statehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.

In 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska – Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good Friday earthquake===
{{Main Article|1964 Alaska earthquake}}
On March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides. It was the [[Largest earthquakes by magnitude|second-most-powerful earthquake]] in the recorded history of the world, with a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 9.2. It was over one thousand times more powerful than the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|1989 San Francisco earthquake]]. The time of day (5:36&amp;nbsp;pm), time of year and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives, particularly in Anchorage.

===Discovery of oil===
The 1968 discovery of oil at [[Prudhoe Bay]] and the 1977 completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] led to an oil boom. Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.

In 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], spilling over {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline. Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] and the proposed [[Pebble Mine]].

===Alaska Heritage Resources Survey===
The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted [[inventory]] of all reported [[historic site|historic]] and [[prehistoric]] sites within the state of Alaska; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology. The survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are over 50 years old. As of January 31, 2012, over 35,000 sites have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/oha/ahrs/ahrs.htm Alaska Heritage Resources Survey], Department of Natural Resources – Alaska.gov (retrieved May 9, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{further information|Alaska Native languages}}
According to the 2011 [[American Community Survey]], 83.4% of people over the age of five speak only English at home. About 3.5% speak Spanish at home. About 2.2% speak another [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] at home and about 4.3% speak an [[Languages of Asia|Asian]] language (including [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) at home.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;50 Quick Facts about Alaska&quot; {{ISBN|978-1-783-33276-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 5.3% speak other languages at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2013/acs/acs-22.pdf|title=Language use in the United States, 2011|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Native Language Center]] at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] claims that at least 20 [[Alaska Native languages|Alaskan native languages]] exist and there are also some languages with different dialects.&lt;ref name=&quot;uaf.edu&quot;&gt;Languages, Alaska Native Language Center, http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/languages/&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Alaska's native languages belong to either the [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo–Aleut]] or [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]] language families however some languages are thought to be [[Language isolate|isolates]] (e.g. [[Haida language|Haida]]) or have not yet been classified (e.g. [[Tsimshianic languages|Tsimshianic]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;uaf.edu&quot;/&gt;
{{as of|2014}} nearly all of Alaska's native languages were classified as either threatened, shifting, moribund, nearly extinct, or dormant languages.&lt;ref&gt;Languages, Alaska Native Language Center, [[Ethnologue]] (classifications), http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/languages/stats/&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 20 [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous languages]],&lt;ref&gt;Graves, K, PhD, MSW, Rosich, R, PhD, McBride, M, PhD, RN, Charles, G, Phd and LaBelle, J, MA: Health and health care if Alaska Native Older Adults. http://geriatrics.stanford.edu/ethnomed/alaskan/.

==Economy==
{{Main article|Economy of Alaska}}
{{See also|Alaska locations by per capita income}}
[[File:Prudhoe Bay aerial FWS.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of infrastructure at the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]].]]

The 2007 [[gross state product]] was $44.9&amp;nbsp;billion, 45th in the nation. Its [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita (nominal)|per capita personal income]] for 2007 was $40,042, ranking 15th in the nation. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Robert|title=Top states for millionaires per capita|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/101338309|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.

Agriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.

Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.

===Energy===
{{See also|Natural gas in Alaska|Energy law#Alaska law}}
[[File:Alaska Pipeline Closeup Underneath.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] transports oil, Alaska's most financially important export, from the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] to [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]. Pertinent are the [[heat pipe]]s in the column mounts, which disperse heat upwards and prevent melting of [[permafrost]].]]
Alaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted. Major oil and gas reserves were found in the [[Alaska North Slope]] (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the [[Energy Information Administration]], by February 2014 Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=ak |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Alaska |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=March 27, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rankings: Crude Oil Production, February 2013|url=http://www.eia.gov/state/rankings/?sid=US&amp;CFID=11011948&amp;CFTOKEN=1da5d5e517e7a485-37ABEB4E-25B3-1C83-549C71EE21A56018&amp;jsessionid=84305d8fd0e59a4565705d1e106846494687#/series/46|publisher=United States Energy Information Administration|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about {{convert|400000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, although by early 2014 North Dakota's [[Bakken Formation]] was producing over {{convert|900000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/stats/historicalbakkenoilstats.pdf | title=ND Monthly Bakken Oil Production Statistics | publisher=North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources | accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prudhoe Bay was the largest [[conventional oil]] field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada's enormous [[Athabasca oil sands]] field, which by 2014 was producing about {{convert | 1500000  | oilbbl/d | m3/d}} of [[unconventional oil]], and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.capp.ca/getdoc.aspx?DocId=227308 | title=Crude Oil Forecast, Markets and Transportation | publisher=Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers |date=June 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] can transport and pump up to {{convert|2.1|Moilbbl|m3}} of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins. The [[United States Geological Survey]] estimates that there are {{convert|85.4|Tcuft|km3}} of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74 |title=Gas Hydrates on Alaska's North Slope |publisher=Usgs.gov |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601170523/http://www.usgs.gov/corecast/details.asp?ep=74 |archivedate=June 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=AK |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Alaska |publisher=Tonto.eia.doe.gov |date=August 27, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103203218/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=AK |archivedate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|Alaska Crude Oil Reserves.PNG|190|Alaska Crude Oil Production.PNG|240|Alaska [[proven reserves|proven oil reserves]] peaked in 1978 and have declined more than 60% since then.|Alaska oil production peaked in 1988 and has declined more than 65% since then.}}
Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special [[single-wire earth return#Use in interties|low-cost electric interties]]) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216014031/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |title=Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan |date=April 2001 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.

====Permanent Fund====
The [[Alaska Permanent Fund]] is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]]. The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.

The [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&amp;nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|work=apfc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.

Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 &quot;Resource Rebate&quot;). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |title=State of Alaska Permanent Fund Division |publisher=Pfd.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420014117/http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.

The Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a &quot;[[Basic income|Basic Income]]&quot; policy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alaska's Citizens' Dividend Set To Be Near Highest Ever|url = http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/alaska-usa-dividend-amount-estimated-to-be-near-highest-ever/|website = BIEN|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of living===
The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Agriculture and fishing===
[[File:Pacific Halibut Fileting.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Halibut]] is important to the state's economy as both a commercial and sport-caught fish.]]

Due to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.

The [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].

Alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&amp;printable=true&amp;contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth &amp;#124; USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date= August 5, 2011|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|Heavy-lift_melon.jpg|190|Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg|200|Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right).}}
Alaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the [[Alaska State Fair]] in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. &quot;Alaska Grown&quot; is used as an agricultural slogan.

Alaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |title=Alaska Department of Fish and Game |publisher=Adfg.alaska.gov |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624202032/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |archivedate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunting for subsistence, primarily [[caribou]], [[moose]], and [[Dall sheep]] is still common in the state, particularly in remote [[The Bush (Alaska)|Bush]] communities. An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.

Alaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|&quot;Outside&quot;]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20–30¢ higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

===Roads===
{{See also|List of Alaska Routes}}
[[File:Susitnabridge.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Susitna River]] bridge on the [[Denali Highway]] is {{convert|1036|ft}} long.]]
[[File:Interstate Alaska map.png|thumb|[[Interstate Highways in Alaska|Alaska Interstate Highways]].]]

Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.

One unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], an active [[Alaska Railroad]] tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] on [[Prince William Sound]] to the [[Seward Highway]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Anchorage at [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]]. At {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1}}, the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;completion of the {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=on|1}} [[Interstate 93]] tunnel as part of the &quot;[[Big Dig]]&quot; project in Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel is the longest combination [[List of road-rail tunnels|road and rail tunnel]] in North America.

===Rail===
[[File:Alaska Railroad.jpg|thumb|An Alaska Railroad locomotive and tanker cars crossing the [[George Parks Highway]] in 1994.]]
[[File:Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, In to the Tunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] traverses rugged terrain north of [[Skagway]] near the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]].]]

Built around 1915, the [[Alaska Railroad]] (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as &quot;The Railbelt&quot;. In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.

The railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.

The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.

In northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''

The Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6&amp;nbsp;million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |title=Alaska Oil / BC Tar sands via rail |author=Barbara Yaffe |date=January 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219014658/http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |archivedate=December 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2138860820070622| title= Economic study touts Alaska-Canada rail link| author=Allan Dowd   | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=January 2, 2011 |agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RailLink3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |title=Alaska Canada Rail Link |author=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |date=January 2, 2005 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425025223/http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alaska Rail Marine]] provides [[car float]] service between [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Seattle]].

===Marine transport===
Many cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.

[[File:Tustumena, Alaska Marine Highway.jpg|thumb|The {{MV|Tustumena}} (named after [[Tustumena Glacier]]) is one of the state's many ferries, providing service between the [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]] and the [[Aleutian Chain]].]]

Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]]) serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|southeast]], the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula. The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers. The system also operates a ferry service from [[Bellingham, Washington]] and [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] in Canada through the [[Inside Passage]] to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. The [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]] also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.

In recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast. The population of [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]] may rise by over 10,000 people on many days during the summer, as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock, debarking thousands of passengers.

===Air transport===
Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed [[Alaskan Bush|bush]] air services—an Alaskan novelty. Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport#Airlines and destinations|many major airlines]]. Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]] to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012–2013, Alaska received almost 2 million visitors).&lt;ref&gt;State of Alaska Office of Economic Development.

Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the [[Essential Air Service]] program. [[Alaska Airlines]] is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger [[Boeing 737]]-400s) from Anchorage and [[Fairbanks International Airport|Fairbanks]] to regional hubs like [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]], [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]], [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]], and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.

[[File:ERA Aviation prop plane landing at ANC (6194226738).jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier Dash 8]], operated by [[Era Alaska]], on approach to [[Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport]].]]

The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as [[Ravn Alaska]], [[PenAir]], and [[Frontier Flying Service]]. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.

Many communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs. In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.&lt;ref&gt;Out of the estimated 663,661 residents, 8,550 were pilots, or about one in 78, Federal Aviation Administration. ''[http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/2005/ 2005 U.S. Civil Airman Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229221505/http://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/civil_airmen_statistics/2005/ |date=December 29, 2009 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other transport===
Another Alaskan transportation method is the [[dogsled]]. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog [[mushing]] is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], a {{convert|1150|mi|adj=on}} trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at {{convert|1049|mi|km|disp=or|abbr=out}}). The race commemorates the famous [[1925 serum run to Nome]] in which mushers and dogs like [[Togo (dog)|Togo]] and [[Balto]] took much-needed medicine to the [[diphtheria]]-stricken community of [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The &quot;Serum Run&quot; is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of [[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]] (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serumrun.org/ |title=Norman Vaughan Serum Run |publisher=United Nations |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303205023/http://serumrun.org/ |archivedate=March 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas not served by road or rail, primary transportation in summer is by [[all-terrain vehicle]] and in winter by [[snowmobile]] or &quot;snow machine,&quot; as it is commonly referred to in Alaska.

===Data transport===
Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: [[GCI (company)|GCI]] and [[Alaska Communications]]. GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaunited.com/|title=Alaska United Fiber Optic System homepage |publisher=Alaskaunited.com |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has &quot;two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskacommunications.com/Personal/Wireless/Coverage-Map.aspx Alaska Communications Coverage Map]. Alaska Communications.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/2010/01/13/1091946/arctic-fiber-optic-cable-could.html Arctic fiber-optic cable could benefit far-flung Alaskans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111123619/http://www.adn.com/2010/01/13/1091946/arctic-fiber-optic-cable-could.html |date=January 11, 2012 }}.

==Law and government==

===State government===
[[File:Juneau, Alaska Downtown.jpg|thumb|The center of state government in [[Juneau]]. The large buildings in the background are, from left to right: the Court Plaza Building (known colloquially as the &quot;[[Spam (food)|Spam Can]]&quot;), the State Office Building (behind), the Alaska Office Building, the [[List of Justices of the Alaska Supreme Court|John H. Dimond]] State Courthouse, and the [[Alaska State Capitol]]. Many of the smaller buildings in the foreground are also occupied by state government agencies.]]
{{Main article|Government of Alaska}}

Like all other U.S. states, Alaska is governed as a republic, with three [[separation of powers|branches of government]]: an [[executive branch]] consisting of the [[Governor of Alaska]] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; a [[legislative branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] and [[Alaska Senate]]; and a [[judicial branch]] consisting of the [[Alaska Supreme Court]] and lower courts.

The state of Alaska employs approximately 16,000 people statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doa.alaska.gov/dop/fileadmin/DOP_Home/pdf/dopannualreport.pdf |title=State of Alaska Workforce Profile Fiscal Year 2013 |publisher=Dop.state.ak.us |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Legislature]] consists of a 40-member [[Alaska House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and a 20-member [[Alaska Senate|Senate]]. Senators serve four-year terms and House members two. The [[Governor of Alaska]] serves four-year terms. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]] runs separately from the governor in the [[Primary election|primaries]], but during the general election, the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket.

Alaska's court system has four levels: the [[Alaska Supreme Court]], the [[Alaska Court of Appeals]], the superior courts and the district courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm |title=About the Alaska Court System |publisher=State.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913093708/http://www.state.ak.us/courts/ctinfo.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superior and district courts are [[trial court]]s. Superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction, while district courts only hear certain types of cases, including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to $100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt;

The Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals are [[appellate court]]s. The Court of Appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower-court decisions, including those regarding criminal prosecutions, juvenile delinquency, and [[habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt; The Supreme Court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;cts&quot;/&gt;

Although in its early years of statehood Alaska was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state, since the early 1970s it has been characterized as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-leaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://election.nationaljournal.com/states/ak.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115144037/http://election.nationaljournal.com/states/ak.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 15, 2006 |title=National Journal Alaska State Profile |publisher=Election.nationaljournal.com |accessdate=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights. [[Alaska Natives]], while organized in and around their communities, have been active within the [[Alaska Native Regional Corporations|Native corporations]]. These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.

Alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.&lt;ref name=seattle_times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html |title=Judge rules against Alaska marijuana law |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |last=Volz |first=Matt |date=July 11, 2006 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |publisher=Frank A. Blethen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617044034/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003118645_webpot10.html |archivedate=June 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the [[Alaskan Independence Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIPqa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akip.org/faqs.html|title=Questions And Answers – About Alaskan Independence |year=2006|publisher=Alaskan Independence Party}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and four [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have served as governor of Alaska. In addition, Republican Governor [[Wally Hickel]] was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected. He officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.

Alaska's voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on February 24, 2015, placing Alaska alongside Colorado and Washington as the first three U.S. states where recreational marijuana is legal. The new law means people over age 21 can consume small amounts of pot – if they can find it. There is a rather lengthy and involved application process, per  [[Alaska Measure 2 (2014)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/02/24/388673136/marijuana-is-now-legal-in-alaska-the-third-u-s-state-to-ok-pot |title=Marijuana Is Now Legal In Alaska, The 3rd U.S. State With Legal Pot |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |last=Chappel |first=Bill |date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first legal marijuana store opened in Valdez in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Laurel,[https://www.adn.com/alaska-marijuana/2016/10/29/anticipation-builds-as-alaskas-first-marijuana-store-set-to-open-to-the-public/ Marijuana milestone: Alaska's first pot shop opens to the public in Valdez] ''[[Alaska Dispatch News]], 10/29/2016''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxes===
To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Money (2005). &quot;How tax friendly is your state?&quot; Retrieved from [http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/lists/taxesbystate2005/index.html CNN website].&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of five states with no state [[sales tax]], one of seven states that do not levy an individual [[income tax]], and one of the two states that has neither. The Department of Revenue Tax Division&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax.state.ak.us/ |title=Department of Revenue Tax Division |publisher=Tax.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports regularly on the state's revenue sources. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.

While Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, [[severance tax]]es, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.

[[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]] (FNSB). A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading lawmakers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco.

In 2014 the [[Tax Foundation]] ranked Alaska as having the fourth most &quot;business friendly&quot; tax policy, behind only [[Wyoming]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/how-friendly-your-states-tax-system-tax-foundations-2014-state-business-tax-climate-index |title=How Friendly Is Your State's Tax System?

Alaska regularly supports [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Republicans have won the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] votes in all but one election that it has participated in ([[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]]). No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his landslide election in [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964]], while the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]] elections were close. Since [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972]], however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008]], Republican [[John McCain]] defeated Democrat [[Barack Obama]] in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was [[Sarah Palin]], the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012]], but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.

The [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaska Bush]], central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing. {{as of|2004}}, well over half of all registered voters have chosen &quot;Non-Partisan&quot; or &quot;Undeclared&quot; as their affiliation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223222/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters.

Because of its population relative to other U.S. states, Alaska has only one member in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]. This seat is held by Republican [[Don Young]], who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012. [[Alaska's at-large congressional district]] is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world.

In 2008, Governor [[Sarah Palin]] became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became [[John McCain]]'s running mate. She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor's job in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-palin/ |title= Topic – Sarah Palin |publisher=Washington Times |accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of United States Senators from Alaska|Alaska's United States Senators]] belong to [[Classes of United States Senators|Class 2 and Class 3]]. In 2008, Democrat [[Mark Begich]], mayor of Anchorage, defeated long-time Republican senator [[Ted Stevens]]. Stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election. The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.

Republican [[Frank Murkowski]] held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State Representative [[Lisa Murkowski]] as his successor. She won full six-year terms in 2004 and 2010.

Alaska is not divided into [[County (United States)|counties]], as most of the other U.S. states, but it is divided into ''[[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|boroughs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title=Alaska Boroughs – &quot;Official&quot; sites
| publisher=CountyState.Info

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the [[Unorganized Borough, Alaska|Unorganized Borough]].

The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 [[census area]]s solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A ''recording district'' is a mechanism for administration of the [[public record]] in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State [[recorder of deeds|Recorder]]. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Whereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the [[Unorganized Borough]]. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Anchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]]) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The state's most populous city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest [[Alaska locations by per capita income|location in Alaska by per capita income]] is [[Halibut Cove, Alaska|Halibut Cove]] ($89,895).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HolwxdMeTwYC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=The+state's+most+populous+city+is+Anchorage,+home+to+278,700+people+in+2006,+225,744+of+whom+live+in+the+urbanized+area.+The+richest+location+in+Alaska+by+per+capita+income+is+Halibut+Cove+($89,895).&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lG6Z1JOQVU&amp;sig=fin_kK74lKXkieCooXnyu4tuOHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidvrTFlNzTAhXVFsAKHTCBDzcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%20The%20state's%20most%20populous%20city%20is%20Anchorage,%20home%20to%20278,700%20people%20in%202006,%20225,744%20of%20whom%20live%20in%20the%20urbanized%20area.%20The%20richest%20location%20in%20Alaska%20by%20per%20capita%20income%20is%20Halibut%20Cove%20($89,895).&amp;f=false|title=The United States of America|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakutat City]], Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four [[List of U.S. cities by area|largest cities in the U.S. by area]].

===Cities and census-designated places (by population)===
As reflected in the [[2010 United States Census]], Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a [[consolidated city–county]]. The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as &quot;[[The Bush (Alaska)|The Bush]]&quot; and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.

Of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place. Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}  CDPs have not been established for these areas by the [[United States Census Bureau]], except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 Census]] (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North [[Tongass Highway]], [[Pennock Island]] and [[Saxman, Alaska|Saxman]] East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the [[Unorganized Borough]], in largely remote areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Public health and public safety==
{{See also|Dentistry in rural Alaska}}
The [[Alaska State Troopers]] are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on &quot;Public Safety Officers&quot; who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations.

The [[Alaska Native Heritage Center]] celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups. Their purpose is to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people and enhance self-esteem among Native people. The [[Alaska Native Arts Foundation]] promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskanativearts.org|title=Alaska Native Arts Foundation|work=alaskanativearts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main article|Music of Alaska}}
Influences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe. Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], traditional Aleut flautist [[Mary Youngblood]], folk singer-songwriter [[Libby Roderick]], Christian music singer-songwriter [[Lincoln Brewster]], metal/post hardcore band [[36 Crazyfists]] and the groups [[Pamyua]] and [[Portugal.

The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the [[Anchorage Symphony Orchestra]], though the [[Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Juneau Symphony]] are also notable. The [[Anchorage Opera]] is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.

The official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Alaska is &quot;[[Alaska's Flag]]&quot;, which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the [[flag of Alaska]].

[[File:Bow bow.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Films featuring Alaskan wolves usually employ domesticated [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s to stand in for wild wolves.]]

Alaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was ''[[The Chechahcos]]'', produced by Alaskan businessman [[Austin E. Lathrop]] and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.

One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent]]'', starring Alaska Native [[Ray Mala]]. In 1932 an expedition set out from [[MGM]]'s studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as &quot;The Biggest Picture Ever Made.&quot;  Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up &quot;Camp Hollywood&quot; in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. [[Louis B. Mayer]] spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in Hollywood to prepare meals.

When ''Eskimo'' premiered at the [[Astor Theatre, New York City|Astor Theatre]] in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history to that point. ''Eskimo'' was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. ''Eskimo'' won the first Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]] culture on film.

The 1983 Disney movie ''[[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Never Cry Wolf]]'' was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', based on [[Jack London]]'s novel and starring [[Ethan Hawke]], was filmed in and around [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. [[Steven Seagal]]'s 1994 ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', starring [[Michael Caine]], was filmed in part at the [[Worthington Glacier]] near [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/OnDeadlyGround/ |title=On Deadly Ground |publisher=Filminamerica.com |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1999 [[John Sayles]] film ''[[Limbo (1999 film)|Limbo]]'', starring [[David Strathairn]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]], was filmed in Juneau.

The psychological thriller ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robin Williams]], was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska. The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into The Wild]]'', was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of [[Christopher McCandless]], who died in a remote abandoned bus along the [[Stampede Trail]] west of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] in 1992.

Many films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in [[Roslyn, Washington]]. The 2007 horror feature ''[[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]]'' is set in [[Barrow, Alaska|Barrow]], but was filmed in New Zealand.

Many [[reality television]] shows are filmed in Alaska. In 2011 the ''Anchorage Daily News'' found ten set in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;hopkins20110214&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2011/02/14/1699528/alaska-based-shows-what-do-the.html |title=Rating the Alaska reality shows: The best and the worst |work=Anchorage Daily News |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |author=Hopkins, Kyle |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302051556/http://www.adn.com/2011/02/14/1699528/alaska-based-shows-what-do-the.html |archivedate=March 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Agriculture}}

'''Agriculture''' or '''[[farm]]ing''' is the cultivation and breeding of [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[Fungus|fungi]] for [[food]], [[fiber]], [[biofuel]], [[medicinal plants]] and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |pages=77– |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key development in the rise of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[human civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that nurtured the development of [[civilization]]. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, [[culture]]s, and technologies. [[Industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have in many cases sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in [[animal husbandry]] have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormone]]s, and other chemicals commonly used in [[industrial meat production]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are an increasing component of agriculture, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of [[aquifer]]s, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. Specific foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]]s and [[spice]]s. Fibers include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. Raw materials include [[lumber]] and [[bamboo]]. Other useful materials are also produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s, [[natural dye|dyes]], [[drug]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[biofuel]]s and ornamental products such as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] and [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]]. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

== Etymology and terminology ==

The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', &quot;field&quot;, and ''cultūra'', &quot;[[Tillage|cultivation]]&quot; or &quot;growing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=14|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories|editor=Chantrell, Glynnis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-863121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626 |title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=36 |pages=563–95|date=December 2005 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626 |author1=Ulrich G. Mueller |author2=Nicole M. Gerardo |author3=Duur K. Aanen |author4=Diana L. Six |author5=Ted R. Schultz }}&lt;/ref&gt; To practice agriculture means to use natural resources to &quot;produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services.&quot;&lt;ref name=Maine /&gt; This definition includes [[arable farming]] or [[agronomy]], and [[horticulture]], all terms for the growing of plants, [[animal husbandry]] and [[forestry]].&lt;ref name=Maine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html |title=Definition of Agriculture|publisher=State of Maine |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it is acknowledged that there is a large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between [[silviculture]] (the management of forests) and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMw9VcLT-FYC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15 |title=Forestry Research: A Mandate for Change |author=Committee on Forestry Research, National Research Council&lt;!--that's one body--&gt; |publisher=National Academies Press |year=1990 |isbn=0-309-04248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term [[agroforestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80364e/80364E04.htm#Agro-forestry%20and%20forest%20laws,%20policies,%20and%20customs |chapter=Applicability of agro-forestry systems |author=Budowski, Gerardo |publisher=United Nations University |title=Agro-forestry in the African Humid Tropics |editor=MacDonald, L.H. |year=1982 |isbn=92-808-0364-6 |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], and [[fertilizers]] were introduced soon after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and developed much further in the past 200 years, starting with the [[British Agricultural Revolution]]. Since 1900, agriculture in the developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labor has been replaced by [[Mechanized farming|mechanization]], and assisted by [[synthetic fertilizer]]s, pesticides, and [[selective breeding]].

== Agriculture and civilization ==
{{further|Plants in culture}}

[[Civilization]] was the product of the Agricultural [[Neolithic Revolution]]; as [[H. G. Wells]] put it, &quot;civilization was the agricultural surplus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=H. G. Wells |authorlink=H. G. Wells |title=World Set Free |titlelink=World Set Free | publisher=Macmillan |date=1914 |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of history, civilization coincided in space with fertile areas such as [[The Fertile Crescent]], and [[Carneiro's circumscription theory|states formed mainly in circumscribed agricultural lands]]. The [[Great Wall]] of China and the Roman empire's ''[[limes]]'' (borders) demarcated the same northern frontier of cereal agriculture. This cereal belt fed the civilizations formed in the [[Axial Age]] and connected by the [[Silk Road]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Ancient Egyptians, whose agriculture depended exclusively on the [[Nile]], deified the river, worshipped, and exalted it in a great hymn.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Egyptian Literature: A Book of Readings'', (ed. Miriam Lichtheim, Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles &amp; London: University of California Press, 1975, vol I, pp. 205–09).&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese imperial court issued numerous edicts, stating: &quot;Agriculture is the foundation of this Empire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Han Agriculture: The Foundation of Early Chinese Agrarian Economy, 206 BC – AD 220'', (ed. Cho-yun Hsu, Seattle &amp; London: University of Washington Press, pp. 169–70).&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Chinese, and Inca Emperors themselves plowed ceremonial fields in order to show personal example to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guan Zhong]], ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]: Economic Dialogues in Ancient China'', (trs. Po-fu Tan, &amp; Kuang-wen Wen, Connecticut: New Heaven, 1954, p. 174); [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], ''History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Man's Recorded History'', New York: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953, pp. 96–97; Rafael Karsten, ''A Totalitarian State of the Past: The Civilization of the Inca Empire in Ancient Peru'', Helsingforce: Academic Bookstore, 1949, pp. 93, 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient strategists, Chinese [[Guan Zhong]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]: Economic Dialogues in Ancient China'', (trs. Po-fu Tan, &amp; Kuang-wen Wen, Connecticut: New Heaven, 1954, pp. 94, 129–30, 156–57, 362).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shang Yang]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Governor of the Shang Region'',( tr. L. S. Perelomov, Moscow: Nauka, 1993, p. 153).&lt;/ref&gt; and Indian [[Kautilya]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthashastra]], (tr. T. N. Ramaswamy, London: Asia Publishers, 1962, pp. 126, 128).&lt;/ref&gt; drew doctrines linking agriculture with military power. Agriculture defined the limits on how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. Shang Yang called agriculture and war the ''One''.&lt;ref&gt;One chapter Shang Yang titled &quot;Reflections on the One,&quot; ''The Book of the Governor of the Shang Region'', (p. 150).&lt;/ref&gt; In the vast human pantheon of agricultural deities&lt;ref&gt;Category:agricultural deities; Category:agricultural gods&lt;/ref&gt; there are several deities who combined the functions of agriculture and war.&lt;ref&gt;The Mesopotamian [[Lahmu]]; the Hittite goddess of [[Arinna]], and the Roman [[Janus]].  From Lahmu derive two Hebrew words—warfare (lehima) and bread (lehem).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution produced civilization, the modern Agricultural Revolution, begun in Britain ([[British Agricultural Revolution]]), made possible the [[industrial civilization]]. The first precondition for industry was greater yields by less manpower, resulting in greater percentage of manpower available for non-agricultural sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barrington Moore]], ''Social Origins of Democracy and Dictatorship'', (London: Penguin Books, 1967, p. 429; Shepard B. Clough &amp; Richard T. Rapp, ''European Economic History: The Economic Development of Western Civilization'', (London &amp; Sydney: McGraw-Hill, 1968, p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of agriculture ==
[[File:Reindeer herding.jpg|thumb|[[Reindeer]] herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several Arctic and Subarctic peoples.]]

[[Pastoralism]] involves managing domesticated animals. In [[nomadic pastoralism]], herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blench | first=Roger | title=Pastoralists in the new millennium | publisher=FAO | date=2001 | pages=11–12 | url=http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[shifting cultivation]], a small area of a forest is cleared by cutting down all the trees and the area is burned. The land is then used for growing crops for several years. When the soil becomes less fertile, the area is then abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shifting cultivation|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden|publisher=[[Survival International]]|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Subsistence farming]] is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waters, Tony |title=The Persistence of Subsistence Agriculture: life beneath the level of the marketplace |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[intensive farming]], the crops are cultivated for commercial purpose i.e., for selling. The main motive of the farmer is to make profit, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs. This type of farming is mainly practiced in highly developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042533 Encyclopædia Britannica's definition of Intensive Agriculture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcFactSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/biology/livingthingsenvironment/4foodandsustainabilityrev5.shtml BBC School fact sheet on intensive farming]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary agriculture ==

[[File:Precision Farming in Minnesota - Natural Colour.jpg|thumb|[[Satellite]] image of farming in [[Minnesota]]]]

In the past century,  agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, [[water pollution]], and [[Agricultural subsidy|farm subsidies]]. In recent years there has been a backlash against the [[externality|external]] [[environmental awareness|environmental effects]] of conventional agriculture, resulting in the [[organic farming|organic]], [[Regenerative agriculture|regenerative]], and [[sustainable agriculture]] movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;motherjones1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The World Bank |year=1995 |url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=469372&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000009265_3970311122936 |title=Overcoming agricultural pollution of water: the challenge of integrating agricultural and environmental policies in the European Union, Volume 1 |accessdate=15 April 2013 |author=Scheierling, Susanne M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major forces behind this movement has been the [[European Union]], which first certified [[organic food]] in 1991 and began reform of its [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=European Commission |year=2003 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/index_en.htm |title=CAP Reform |accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Decoupling and re-coupling|decoupling]]. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as [[integrated pest management]] and selective breeding. Recent mainstream technological developments include [[genetically modified food]].

Disease and land degradation are two of the major concerns in agriculture today. For example, an epidemic of [[stem rust]] on wheat caused by the [[Ug99]] lineage is currently spreading across Africa and into Asia and is causing major concerns due to crop losses of 70% or more under some conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/rust/stem/rust-report/stem-ug99racettksk/en/ |title=Wheat Stem Rust – UG99 (Race TTKSK)|publisher=FAO|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.&lt;ref&gt;Sample, Ian (31 August 2007).

Agrarian structure is a long-term structure in the [[Fernand Braudel|Braudelian]] understanding of the concept. On a larger scale the agrarian structure is more dependent on the regional, social, cultural and historical factors than on the state’s undertaken activities. Like in Poland, where despite running an intense agrarian policy for many years, the agrarian structure in 2002 has much in common with that found in 1921 soon after the [[History of Poland (1795–1918)|partitions period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agrojournal.org/20/05-03.pdf M. Pietrzak, D. Walczak. 2014.

In 2009, the [[Agriculture in China|agricultural output of China]] was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States, according to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (''[[Agriculture#List of countries by agricultural output|see below]]''). Economists measure the [[total factor productivity]] of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=USDA Economic Research Service |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/agproductivity/ |title=Agricultural Productivity in the United States |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workforce ==

{{As of|2011}}, the [[International Labour Organization]] states that approximately one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, are employed in the global agricultural sector. Agriculture constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry.&lt;ref name=ILO /&gt; The [[service sector]] only overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007. Between 1997 and 2007, the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points, a trend that is expected to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/story/191279 |title=Services sector overtakes farming as world's biggest employer: ILO|agency=Associated Press|date=26 January 2007|accessdate=24 April 2013|publisher=''The Financial Express''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people employed in agriculture varies widely on a per-country basis, ranging from less than 2% in countries like the US and Canada to over 80% in many African nations.&lt;ref name=LaborForce&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html |title=Labor Force – By Occupation |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developed countries, these figures are significantly lower than in previous centuries. During the 16th century in Europe, for example, between 55 and 75 percent of the population was engaged in agriculture, depending on the country.

[[File:Ford Tractor with ROPS bar fitted.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rollover protection system|Rollover protection bar]] on a [[Fordson tractor]]]]{{Main article|Agricultural safety and health}}

Agriculture, specifically [[farm]]ing, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, [[noise-induced hearing loss]], skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On [[industrial agriculture|industrialized farms]], injuries frequently involve the use of [[agricultural machinery]], and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.&lt;ref name=&quot;aginjury&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agricultural Injuries |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_pest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-108/ |title=NIOSH Pesticide Poisoning Monitoring Program Protects Farmworkers |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIOSH Agri&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/agriculture/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agriculture|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIOSH Agri&quot; /&gt;

The International Labour Organization considers agriculture &quot;one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors.&quot;&lt;ref name=ILO&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/standards-and-instruments/codes/WCMS_161135/lang—en/index.htm|title=Safety and health in agriculture |publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported.&lt;ref name=ILO2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/areasofwork/hazardous-work/WCMS_110188/lang—en/index.htm |title=Agriculture: A hazardous work |publisher=International Labour Organization |accessdate=24 April 2013 |date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has developed the [[Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001]], which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.&lt;ref name=ILO /&gt;

== Agricultural production systems ==

=== Crop cultivation systems ===

[[File:Paddy fields in India.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3&lt;!--width for very low image--&gt;|Rice cultivation in [[Andhra Pradesh]], India]]

Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO FS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm |title=Analysis of farming systems|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283–317 in &quot;Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology&quot;. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shifting cultivation]] (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. &quot;Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability&quot;. pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Further industrialization led to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot; /&gt; [[Multiple cropping]], in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring [[irrigation]]. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

=== Livestock production systems ===
{{Main|Livestock}}
{{See also|List of domesticated animals}}

[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|right|Ploughing rice [[paddy field]]s with [[water buffalo]], in [[Indonesia]]]]

Animals, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[donkey]]s, and dogs, are often used to help cultivate fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. Animal husbandry not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.

[[File:Traditional Farming Methods and Equipments.jpg|thumb|An ox-pulled plough in [[India]]]]

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sere, C. |author2=Steinfeld, H. |author3=Groeneweld, J. |year=1995|url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends|publisher=U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2010}}, 30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full|title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects|author=Thornton, Philip K.|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|date=27 September 2010|volume=365|issue=1554|pages=2853–67|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html|title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers|journal=Time|author=Stier, Ken|date=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using [[selective breeding]] focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – Globaldiv|author=P. Ajmone-Marsan|journal=Animal Genetics|date=May 2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02036.x|volume=41| issue = supplement S1|pages=1–5|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot; /&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]](OECD) member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot; /&gt; Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt; Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee|date=23 April 2002|accessdate=6 April 2013|publisher=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production practices ==

[[File:Mt Uluguru and Sisal plantations.jpg|thumb|Road leading across the farm allows machinery access to the farm for production practices]]

Farming is the practice of agriculture by specialized labor in an area primarily devoted to agricultural processes, in service of a dislocated population usually in a [[city]].

Tillage is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soil&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils.

Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pest control includes the management of weeds, [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include [[crop rotation]], [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, intercropping, [[compost]]ing, avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Pest&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production&quot; pp. 240–82 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of [[manure]] produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, [[manure]], [[green manure]], compost and mined [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Soil&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Soil and Land&quot; pp. 165–210 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

[[Water management]] is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt; Some farmers use [[irrigation]] to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the [[Great Plains]] in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Water&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Plants and Soil Water&quot; pp. 211–39 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

According to a report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.&lt;ref name=ifpri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-security-world-natural-resource-scarcity|author=International Food Policy Research Institute|title=Food Security in a World of Growing Natural Resource Scarcity|year=2014|publisher=CropLife International|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Payment for ecosystem services]] (PES) can further incentivise efforts to green the agriculture sector. This is an approach that verifies values and rewards the benefits of ecosystem services provided by green agricultural practices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unep.org&quot;&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Innovative PES measures could include reforestation payments made by cities to upstream communities in rural areas of shared watersheds for improved quantities and quality of fresh water for municipal users. Ecoservice payments by farmers to upstream forest stewards for properly managing the flow of soil nutrients, and methods to monetise the carbon sequestration and emission reduction credit benefits of green agriculture practices in order to compensate farmers for their efforts to restore and build SOM and employ other practices.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unep.org&quot; /&gt;

== Crop alteration and biotechnology ==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}

[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|[[Tractor]] and [[chaser bin]]]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Stadler |first= L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to sharply increase yield by creating &quot;high-yielding varieties&quot;. For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ruttan |first= Vernon W. |title= Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal= AgBioForum |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |pages= 54–60 |date=December 1999 |url= http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cassman |first= K.

[[Genetically modified organism]]s (GMO) are [[organism]]s whose [[Genetics|genetic]] material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as [[recombinant DNA technology]]. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/index.html|title=20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, GMO crops cause [[food safety]] and [[food labeling regulations|food labeling]] concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://current.com/groups/news-blog/93975745_peru-bans-genetically-modified-foods-as-us-lags.htm |title=Peru bans genetically modified foods as US lags |date=28 November 2012 |publisher=Current TV |accessdate=7 May 2013 |author=Whiteside, Stephanie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324013255/http://current.com/groups/news-blog/93975745_peru-bans-genetically-modified-foods-as-us-lags.htm |archivedate=24 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently a global treaty, the [[Biosafety Protocol]], regulates the trade of GMOs.

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]s. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm|title=Benefits and risks of the use of herbicide-resistant crops|author1=Kathrine Hauge Madsen |author2=Jens Carl Streibig |publisher=FAO|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=Weed Management for Developing Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.

Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops protect plants from damage by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/insect.htm |title=Insect-resistant Crops Through Genetic Engineering|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimbrell, A.|title=Fatal Harvest: The Tragedy of Industrial Agriculture|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture, as implemented through the method of farming, imposes external costs upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pretty |year= 2000 |title= An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture |journal= Agricultural Systems |volume= 65 |issue= 2 |pages= 113–36 |doi= 10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7 |first1= J |display-authors= 1 |last2= Brett |first2= C. |last3= Gee |first3= D. |last4= Hine |first4= R.E. |last5= Mason |first5= C.F. |last6= Morison |first6= J.I.L. |last7= Raven |first7= H. |last8= Rayment |first8= M.D. |last9= Van Der Bijl |first9= G.|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222549141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million.&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tegtmeier |first1= E.M. |last2= Duffy |first2= M. |year= 2005 |title= External Costs of Agricultural Production in the United States |journal= The Earthscan Reader in Sustainable Agriculture |url= http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs.

A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem, Henning Steinfeld, said &quot;Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |title=Livestock a major threat to environment |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080328062709/http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |archivedate= 28 March 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of [[greenhouse gas]]es, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5{{nbsp}}million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pimentel pesticide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Pimentel, D. |author2=T.W.

Our planet, our health: Report of the WHO commission on health and environment. Geneva: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides select for [[pesticide resistance]] in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the &quot;pesticide treadmill&quot; in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS Pest&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and D.E. Sadava. 1994. &quot;Strategies for Pest Control&quot; pp. 355–83 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative argument is that the way to &quot;save the environment&quot; and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAvery&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Avery, D.T. |year=2000 |title=Saving the Planet with Pesticides and Plastic: The Environmental Triumph of High-Yield Farming |publisher=Hudson Institute|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Center for Global Food Issues |url=http://www.cgfi.org |title=Center for Global Food Issues |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,&lt;ref name=&quot;WH&quot;&gt;Lappe, F.M., J. Collins, and P. Rosset. 1998. &quot;Myth 4: Food vs. Our Environment&quot; pp. 42–57 in ''World Hunger, Twelve Myths'', Grove Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and that pesticides simply replace [[good agricultural practices|good agronomic practices]] such as crop rotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS Pest&quot; /&gt; The UNEP introduces the [[Push–pull agricultural pest management]] technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. &quot;The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unep.org&quot; /&gt;

=== Climate change ===
{{See also|Climate change and agriculture}}

Climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[solar radiation]] and the interaction of these elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt; Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harvey, Fiona |date=18 November 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/18/extreme-weather-climate-change-ipcc |title=Extreme weather will strike as climate change takes hold, IPCC warns|journal=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/11374Nile%20concise.pdf |title=Report: Blue Peace for the Nile |publisher=Strategic Foresight Group |accessdate=20 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908163426/http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/11374Nile%20concise.pdf |archivedate=8 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bs-agro.com/index.php/20152-pessimism-about-future-grows-in-agribusiness|title=World: Pessimism about future grows in agribusiness|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110041224/http://bs-agro.com/index.php/20152-pessimism-about-future-grows-in-agribusiness|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability.

Agriculture in its many forms can both mitigate or worsen [[global warming]]. Some of the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] comes from the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice [[paddy field]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. &quot;Soil Organic Matter&quot; pp. 353–85 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further, wet or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] soils also lose nitrogen through [[denitrification]], releasing the greenhouse gases [[nitric oxide]] and nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils N&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. &quot;Nitrogen and Sulfur Economy of Soils&quot; pp. 386–421 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester]] some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot; /&gt; Informed by the UNEP, &quot;[a]griculture also produces about 58 per cent of global nitrous oxide emissions and about 47 per cent of global methane emissions. Cattle and rice farms release methane, fertilized fields release nitrous oxide, and the cutting down of rainforests to grow crops or raise livestock releases carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Five-Step Plan to Feed The World |last=Foley |first=Jonathan |date=May 2014 |work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these gases have a far greater global warming potential per tonne than CO2 (298 times and 25 times respectively).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;unep.org&quot; /&gt;

There are several factors within the field of agriculture that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillier |first=Jonathon |author2=C. Hawes |author3=G. Squire |author4=A. Hilton |title=The carbon footprints of food crop production |journal=International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability |year=2009 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=107–18 |doi=10.3763/ijas.2009.0419|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228649298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels from the beginning of the process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lal |first=Rattan |title=Carbon emission from farm operations |journal=Environmental International |year=2004 |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=981–90 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2004.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=West |first=T.O. |author2=G. Marland |title=Net carbon flux from agricultural ecosystems: methodology for full carbon cycle analyses |journal=Environmental Pollution |year=2002 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=439–44 |doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(01)00221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainability ===
{{See also|List of sustainable agriculture topics}}

Some major organizations are hailing farming within [[agroecosystem]]s as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to a report by the [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[UNEP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=Boelee, E. |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/|title=Ecosystems for water and food security|year=2011|publisher=IWMI/UNEP |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for
more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Molden, D.|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |title=Opinion: The Water Deficit|format=PDF|publisher=''The Scientist''|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://croplife.intraspin.com/pesticides/paper.asp?id=461|author=Safefood Consulting, Inc.|title=Benefits of Crop Protection Technologies on Canadian Food Production, Nutrition, Economy and the Environment|year=2005|publisher=CropLife International|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New technologies have given rise to innovations like [[conservation tillage]], a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trewavas, Anthony|title=A critical assessment of organic farming-and-food assertions with particular respect to the UK and the potential environmental benefits of no-till agriculture|journal=Crop Protection |year=2004|pages=757–81|doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2004.01.009|volume=23|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),&lt;ref name=ifpri /&gt; agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, IFPRI found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.

This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of [[value added|value addition]] (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sexton, R.J. |year= 2000 |title= Industrialization and Consolidation in the US Food Sector: Implications for Competition and Welfare |journal= American Journal of Agricultural Economics |volume= 82 |issue= 5 |pages= 1087–104 |doi= 10.1111/0002-9092.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, it was clear that non-subsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Do Global Trade Distortions Still Harm Developing Country Farmers?|author1=Kym Anderson |author2=Ernesto Valenzuela |work=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3901|date=April 2006|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=16 April 2013|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1 |title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities?|author1=Peter J.

== Energy and agriculture ==

Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from [[fossil fuel]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-453068.html |title=World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021233714/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-453068.html |archivedate=21 October 2010 |work=The Independent |date=14 June 2007 |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of the Green Revolution: Implications for International Grain Markets|author=Robert W.

Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on [[petrochemical]]s and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot; /&gt;

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1. direct consumption on the farm and 2. indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid [[propane]], and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Schnepf, Randy|date=19 November 2004|title=Energy use in Agriculture: Background and Issues|work=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and [[natural gas]] used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot; /&gt; The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by [[The Royal Society]], agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2991.full|title=Energy and the food system|author1=Jeremy Woods |author2=Adrian Williams |author3=John K.

Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot; /&gt; [[Food systems]] encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;css.snre.umich.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author1=Martin Heller |author2=Gregory Keoleian |year=2000 |title=Life Cycle-Based Sustainability Indicators for Assessment of the U.S. Food System |publisher=University of Michigan Center for Sustainable Food Systems |url=http://css.snre.umich.edu/css_doc/CSS00-04.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=17 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314094203/http://css.snre.umich.edu/css_doc/CSS00-04.pdf |archivedate=14 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ers.usda.gov&quot; /&gt;

In the event of a petroleum shortage (see [[peak oil]] for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from conventional farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misa.umn.edu/Search_and_Ask/FAQ/FeedtheWorld/index.htm |title=Organic Can Feed the World |date=December 5, 2011 |author=Barry Estabrook |publisher=The Atlantic |accessdate=14 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425185714/http://www.misa.umn.edu/Search_and_Ask/FAQ/FeedtheWorld/index.htm |archivedate=25 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including [[biopesticides]], plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chge.med.harvard.edu/resource/cuban-organic-farming-experiment|title=Cuban Organic Farming Experiment|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, organic farming may be more [[labour (economics)|labor]]-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Strochlic, R. |author2=Sierra, L. |year=2007|url=http://ccwiki.pbworks.com/f/CAStudy-Barriers-Organic-CIRS-2007.pdf|title= Conventional, Mixed, and &quot;Deregistered&quot; Organic Farmers: Entry Barriers and Reasons for Exiting Organic Production in California|publisher=California Institute for Rural Studies|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[soil conditioner|reconditioning of soil]] to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide a reservoir of plant-available nutrients, to maintain texture, and to minimize erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0100e/a0100e04.htm |title=The importance of soil organic matter: Key to drought-resistant soil and sustained food production |authors=Alexandra Bot and José Benites |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |year=2005 |series=FAO Soils Bulletin |volume=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the [[biochar]] and [[synfuel]] process, which uses agricultural ''waste'' to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel ''and'' food, instead of the normal [[food vs. fuel]] debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU05/11082/EGU05-J-11082-2.pdf|author=P.

== Policy ==
{{Main|Agricultural policy}}

[[File:United States farm subsidies (source Congressional Budget Office).svg|thumb|290px|From a [[Congressional Budget Office]] report]]

[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=13 |title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia |journal=Sustainable agriculture and food policy in the 21st century: challenges and solutions |publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics – Bureau of Rural Sciences |date=October 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2013 |author1=Lindsay Hogan |author2=Paul Morris |url=http://adl.brs.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001749/CP10.15_Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321082639/http://adl.brs.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001749/CP10.15_Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER.pdf |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/|title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=European Union|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm|title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy |author=Ikerd, John |journal=Small Farm Today Magazine |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |location=London |first=Juliette |last=Jowit |date= 22 September 2010 |newspaper= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was born in [[Godalming]], Surrey, England, in 1894. He was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley,]] who edited ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.nls.uk/jma/topics/publishing/cornhill.html|title=Cornhill Magazine – The John Murray Archive – National Library of Scotland|website=digital.nls.uk|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his first wife, Julia Arnold, who founded [[Prior's Field School]]. Julia was the niece of poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] and the sister of [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphrey Ward]]. Aldous was the grandson of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], the [[Zoology|zoologist]], agnostic, and controversialist (&quot;Darwin's Bulldog&quot;). His brother [[Julian Huxley]] and half-brother [[Andrew Huxley]] also became outstanding biologists. Aldous had another brother, Noel Trevelyan Huxley (1891–1914), who committed suicide after a period of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Charles Mason (1978) ''Aldous Huxley and the Way to Reality.'' Greenwood Press, 1978, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Huxley's nickname was &quot;Ogie&quot;, short for &quot;Ogre&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aldous Huxley|last=Bedford|first=Sybille|publisher=Alfred A.

Huxley's education began in his father's well-equipped botanical laboratory, after which he enrolled at Hillside School near [[Godalming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hull2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James Hull|title=Aldous Huxley, Representative Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bX3EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7663-0|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rintoul2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=M.C.

After Hillside, he went on to [[Eton College]]. His mother died in 1908 when he was 14. In 1911 he contracted the eye disease ([[Keratitis|keratitis punctata]]) which &quot;left [him] practically blind for two to three years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Huxley | first=Aldous |year=1939 |chapter=Biography and bibliography (appendix) |title=After Many A Summer Dies The Swan | series = 1st Perennial Classic |page=243 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brave New World|last=Huxley|first=Aldous|publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics / HarperCollins Publishers|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Aldous Huxley: A Life of the Mind}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1913, Huxley went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he read English Literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot; /&gt; In January 1916, he volunteered to join the [[British Army]] in the [[World War I|Great War]], but was rejected on health grounds, being half-blind in one eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot;&gt;Raychel Haugrud Reiff (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: Brave New World&quot;. p. 112. Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt; His eyesight later partly recovered. In 1916 he edited ''[[Oxford Poetry]]'' and in June of that year graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification#First Class Honours|First Class honours]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff&quot; /&gt; His brother Julian wrote:

{{Quote | I believe his blindness was a blessing in disguise. For one thing, it put paid to his idea of taking up medicine as a career&amp;nbsp;... His uniqueness lay in his universalism. He was able to take all knowledge for his province.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Huxley 1965. ''Aldous Huxley 1894–1963: a Memorial Volume''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following his years at Balliol, Huxley, being financially indebted to his father, decided to find employment. From April to July 1917, he was in charge of ordering supplies at the [[Air Ministry]] &lt;!-- for the [[Royal Air Force]] (can't be true; was founded following year!) --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Murray (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual&quot;. Chapter 7. p. 4. Hachette&lt;/ref&gt; He taught French for a year at [[Eton College|Eton]], where Eric Blair (who was to take the pen name [[George Orwell]]) and [[Steven Runciman]] were among his pupils. He was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class. Nevertheless, Blair and others spoke highly of his brilliant command of language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crick&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Crick |first= Bernard | title = George Orwell: A Life |year=1992 |publisher=Penguin Books | location =London |isbn=978-0-14-014563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, Huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at [[Tata Chemicals Europe|Brunner and Mond]], a high-tech chemical plant in [[Billingham]] in [[County Durham]], northeast England. According to the introduction to the latest edition of his great science fiction novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932), the experience he had there of &quot;an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence&quot; was an important source for the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Baggini |first= Julian |title=Atheism |url= https://books.google.com/?id=DUal7eYmEnEC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2009 |publisher = Sterling |isbn = 978-1-4027-6882-8 |page= 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Huxley completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early 20s, establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist. His first published novels were social satires, ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921), ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923), ''[[Those Barren Leaves]]'' (1925), and ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1928). ''Brave New World'' was Huxley's fifth novel and first dystopian work. In the 1920s he was also a contributor to ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' and [[Vogue (British magazine)|British ''Vogue'']] magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley: Selected Letters&quot;. p. 144. Ivan R. Dee, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bloomsbury Set ===
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: [[Bloomsbury Group]] members – [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys, [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]] ]]
During World War I, Huxley spent much of his time at [[Garsington Manor]] near Oxford, home of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], working as a farm labourer. There he met several [[Bloomsbury Group|Bloomsbury]] figures, including [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Weber | first = Michel | author-link = Michel Weber | url = https://www.academia.edu/3268912/_On_Religiousness_and_Religion._Huxleys_Reading_of_Whiteheads_Religion_in_the_Making_in_the_Light_of_James_Varieties_of_Religious_Experience_2005_ | title = On Religiousness and Religion.

Later, in ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle. Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 [[John Middleton Murry]] was reorganising the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Huxleys | first = Ronald W | last = Clark | publisher = William Heinemann | place = London | year = 1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = George | last = Woodcock | year = 2007 | title = Dawn and the Darkest Hour: A Study of Aldous Huxley | page = 240 | publisher=Black Rose Books}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'', set in a [[dystopia]]n London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.

Starting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |archivedate= 6 June 2011 |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In 1937, Huxley moved to Hollywood with his wife Maria, son [[Matthew Huxley]], and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the US, mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). The book contains tracts on war, religion, nationalism and ethics.

Heard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and [[vegetarianism]] through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938, Huxley befriended [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu [[Swami Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &quot;five senses&quot; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.

Huxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as &quot;Tarzana College&quot; in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley a British literary award, the 1939 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p. 103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.

During this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; [[Christopher Isherwood]], in his autobiography ''My Guru and His Disciple'', states that Huxley earned more than $3,000 per week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the U.S. In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'', which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944). Huxley was commissioned by Walt Disney in 1945 to write a script based on ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and the biography of the story's author, Lewis Carroll. The script was not used, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2010/04/15/mcsweeneys_intellectual_screenplays/ Salon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of [[J. D. Unwin]]'s 1940 book ''Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JD | last = Unwin | title = Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society | year = 1940 | publisher = Oscar Piest | place = NY}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on &quot;how fine and how profoundly important the book is&quot;. In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:
{{Quote | Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Huxley | first=Aldous |editor=Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |location=London |isbn = 978-0-7011-1312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well-marketed commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post World War II ===
In 1953, Huxley and Maria applied for [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizenship]] and presented themselves for examination. When Huxley refused to bear arms for the US and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals, the only excuse allowed under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act|McCarran Act]], the judge had to adjourn the proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reiff2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Raychel Haugrud Reiff|title=Aldous Huxley: Brave New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JyRntokmqYC&amp;pg=PA31|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-4701-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Murray|title=Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h7CKgXGDi4C&amp;pg=PT309|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1231-9|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the US. In 1959 Huxley turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957–1963)|Macmillan government]] without putting forward a reason; his brother Julian had been knighted in 1958, while another brother Andrew would be knighted in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopaedia Britannica''. (2003). Volume 6. p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Association with Vedanta ==
Beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}

In 1944, Huxley wrote the introduction to the &quot;Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isherwood |first1=Christopher |last2=Swami Prabhavananda |last3=Aldous |first3=Huxley |title=Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God |year=1987 |publisher=Vedanta Press |location=Hollywood, Calif |isbn=978-0-87481-043-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.

From 1941 until 1960, Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.

Huxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''[[Knowledge and Understanding]]'' and ''[[Who Are We? (album)|Who Are We?]]'' from 1955. Nonetheless, Huxley's agnosticism, together with his speculative propensity, made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalized religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Weber]], &quot; [https://www.academia.edu/1564486/_Perennial_Truth_and_Perpetual_Perishing._A._Huxleys_Worldview_in_the_Light_of_A._N._Whiteheads_Process_Philosophy_of_Time_2007_ Perennial Truth and Perpetual Perishing. A. Huxley’s Worldview in the Light of A. N. Whitehead’s Process Philosophy of Time] &quot;, in Bernfried Nugel, Uwe Rasch and Gerhard Wagner (eds.), ''Aldous Huxley, Man of Letters: Thinker, Critic and Artist, Proceedings of the Third International Aldous Huxley Symposium Riga 2004'', Münster, LIT, “Human Potentialities”, Band 9, 2007, pp. 31–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1953, Huxley had his first experience with [[psychedelic drug]]s (in this case, [[mescaline]]). Huxley had initiated a correspondence with [[Humphry Osmond|Dr. Humphry Osmond]], a British psychiatrist then employed in a Canadian institution, and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline; Osmond obliged and supervised Huxley’s session in southern California. After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', in which he recounted this experience, Huxley and Swami Prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.

== Eyesight ==
There are differing accounts about the details of the quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. About 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Darst Corbett]], who was able to teach the method to him. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|ha| adj =on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in more than 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (U.S.), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Aldous Huxley Annual|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYFcahCQm4wC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=The+Art+of+Seeing+huxley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ9K27y6zKAhUHKx4KHZ84DjAQuwUIVDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Art%20of%20Seeing%20huxley&amp;f=false|publisher = LIT Verlag Münster|date = 28 February 2011|isbn = 978-3-643-10450-2|language = en|first = Bernfried|last = Nugel|first2 = Jerome|last2 = Meckier|page = 111|chapter = A New Look at The Art of Seeing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens, despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: &quot;Then suddenly he faltered — and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gardner&quot;&gt;Cerf, Bennett (12 April 1952), ''The Saturday Review'' (column), quoted in {{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin | authorlink =Martin Gardner |title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |year=1957 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Archera]], would later emphasise in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': &quot;One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight.&quot; After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a &quot;poor fellow who can hardly see&quot; by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempered this: &quot;Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huxley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Laura |title=This Timeless Moment |year=1968 |publisher= Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-89087-968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing'': &quot;The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable.&quot; Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary LA'' p. 50. Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[popular science]] author [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]], in his book ''Mind Wide Open'', quotes Huxley about his difficulties with [[Encoding (memory)#Visual encoding|visual encoding]]: &quot;I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer. Words, even the pregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep. When I recall something, the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object. By an effort of the will, I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, ''The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell'', Harper Perennial, 1963, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Johnson (author) |title = Mind Wide Open: Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life | location =New York |publisher=Scribner |year=2004 |page=235 |ISBN = 978-0-7432-4165-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Huxley married Maria Nys (10 September 1899 – 12 February 1955), a Belgian he met at [[Garsington]], Oxfordshire, in 1919. They had one child, [[Matthew Huxley]] (19 April 1920 – 10 February 2005), who had a career as an author, anthropologist, and prominent [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31009-2005Feb16.html &quot;Author, NIMH Epidemiologist Matthew Huxley Dies at 84&quot;.] 17 February 2005 ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Maria died of cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In 1956, Huxley married [[Laura Huxley|Laura Archera]] (1911–2007), also an author as well as a violinist and psychotherapist.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; She wrote ''This Timeless Moment'', a biography of Huxley. Laura felt inspired to illuminate the story of their marriage through Mary Ann Braubach's 2010 documentary, &quot;Huxley on Huxley&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huxleyonhuxley.com/about/synopsis/ |title=Huxley on Huxley. |others=Dir. Mary Ann Braubach. Cinedigm, 2010. DVD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Huxley was diagnosed with [[laryngeal cancer]] and, in the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the Utopian novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bowering ''Aldous Huxley: A Study of the Major Novels'', p. 197, Oxford University Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; both at the [[University of California]]'s San Francisco Medical Center and at the [[Esalen Institute]]. These lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the [[Human Potential Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kripal |first=Jeffrey |title=Esalen America and the Religion of No Religion |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2007}}[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/453699.html excerpt].&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was a close friend of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] and [[Rosalind Rajagopal]] and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School (now [[Besant Hill School]] of Happy Valley) in [[Ojai, California]].

The most substantial collection of Huxley's few remaining papers (following the destruction of most in a fire) is at the Library of the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt1489q14s/ |title=Finding Aid for the Aldous and Laura Huxley papers, 1925–2007 |publisher=Special Collections, [[Charles E. Young Research Library]], UCLA |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are also at the [[Stanford University Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findingaids.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=ead/mss/m0107.xml |title=Guide to the Aldous Huxley Collection, 1922–1934 |publisher=Dept. of Special Collections and University Archives |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April 1962, Huxley was informed he was elected Companion of Literature by the [[Royal Society of Literature]], the senior literary organisation in Britain, and he accepted the title via letter on 28 April 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot;&gt;Peter Edgerly Firchow, Hermann Josef Real (2005). &quot;The Perennial Satirist: Essays in Honour of Bernfried Nugel, Presented on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday&quot;, p. 1. LIT Verlag Münster&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence between Huxley and the society are kept at the [[Cambridge University Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot; /&gt; The society invited Huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at [[Somerset House]], London in June 1963. Huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society; however, his deteriorating health meant he would not be able to attend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Society&quot; /&gt;

== Death ==
On his deathbed, unable to speak due to advanced [[laryngeal cancer]], Huxley made a written request to his wife Laura for &quot;LSD, 100 [[Microgram|µg]], [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]]&quot;. According to her account of his death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/03/most-beautiful-death.html |title=Account of Huxley's death on Letters of Note |publisher=Lettersofnote.com |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''This Timeless Moment'', she obliged with an injection at 11:20&amp;nbsp;a.m. and a second dose an hour later; Huxley died aged 69, at 5:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Los Angeles time), on 22 November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Raychel Haugrud Reiff (2009). &quot;Aldous Huxley: Brave New World&quot;. p. 35. Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of Huxley's passing — as with that of the author [[C. S. Lewis]] – was overshadowed by the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy]] on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Ruddick (1993). &quot;Ultimate Island: On the Nature of British Science Fiction&quot;. p. 28. Greenwood Press&lt;/ref&gt; This coincidence served as the basis for [[Peter Kreeft]]'s book ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (novel)|Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy, C. S. Lewis, &amp; Aldous Huxley]]'', which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in Purgatory following their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kreeft|first1=Peter|title=Between Heaven and Hell: A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F.

How might the conversation go?&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's memorial service took place in London in December 1963 which was led by his older brother [[Julian Huxley|Julian]], and on 27 October 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Aldous Huxley:  A Biography| last = Murray| first = Nicholas| publisher = St. Martin's Press| date = 2003| isbn = 978-0312302375| page = 455| url = https://books.google.fr/books?id=tukmDMYu6ysC&amp;lpg=PA455&amp;ots=EvzavKTfre&amp;dq=(%22Aldous%20Huxley%22%7C%22Huxley%20Aldous%22)%20(%22funeral%22%7C%22burial%22%7C%22buried%22%7C%22interment%22%7C%22interred%22)%201971&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA455#v=onepage&amp;q=%2227%20october%201971%22&amp;f=false| accessdate = 9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; his ashes were interred in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery, home of the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] in [[Compton, Guildford]], Surrey, England.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Huxley had been a long-time friend of Russian composer [[Igor Stravinsky]], who later dedicated his last orchestral composition to Huxley. Stravinsky began ''Variations'' in Santa Fé, New Mexico, in July 1963, and completed the composition in Hollywood on 28 October 1964. It was first performed in Chicago on 17 April 1965, by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Craft.&lt;ref&gt;Spies 1965, 62; White 1979, 534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White 1979, 536–37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Relevance to Huxley? : Although not composed for the purpose, Stravinsky's music was twice choreographed for the New York City Ballet by George Balanchine, a first version in 1966, and a second version in 1982, both times under the title ''Variations'' (Barnes 1966; Anderson 1982). --&gt;

'''Algae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|dʒ|i|,_|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|i}}; singular '''alga''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə}}) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[organism]]s which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus [[polyphyletic]]. Included organisms range from [[unicellular]] genera, such as ''[[Chlorella]]'' and the [[diatom]]s, to [[multicellular]] forms, such as the [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelp]], a large [[brown algae|brown alga]] which may grow up to 50&amp;nbsp;m in length. Most are aquatic and [[autotrophic]] and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as [[stoma]]ta, [[xylem]], and [[phloem]], which are found in [[embryophyte|land plants]]. The largest and most complex marine algae are called [[seaweed]]s, while the most complex freshwater forms are the [[Charophyta]], a [[phylum|division]] of green algae which includes, for example, ''[[Spirogyra]]'' and the [[stonewort]]s.

No definition of algae is generally accepted. One definition is that algae &quot;have [[chlorophyll]] as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lee, R. E. |year=2008 |title=Phycology |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors exclude all prokaryotes&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroBot&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabors |first=Murray W. |title=Introduction to Botany |year=2004 |publisher=Pearson Education, Inc |location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-8053-4416-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus do not consider [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) as algae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allaby 92&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor1-last=Allaby |editor1-first=M. |year=1992 |encyclopedia=The Concise Dictionary of Botany |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |title=Algae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algae constitute a polyphyletic group&lt;ref name=&quot;IntroBot&quot;/&gt; since they do not include a common ancestor, and although their plastids seem to have a single origin, from cyanobacteria,&lt;ref name=&quot;keeling&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Diversity and evolutionary history of plastids and their hosts |author=Patrick J. Keeling |url=http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/91/10/1481 |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=2004 |volume=91 |pages=1481–1493 |doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1481 |issue=10 |pmid=21652304|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; they were acquired in different ways. [[Green algae]] are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiotic]] cyanobacteria. [[Diatom]]s and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an [[endosymbiotic theory#Secondary endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] [[red alga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=J.D.

Algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] cell division to complex forms of [[sexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Department of Botany. http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/introduction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of [[bryophyte]]s, [[rhizoid]]s in [[nonvascular plants]], and the [[root]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] found in [[tracheophyte]]s ([[vascular plants]]). Most are [[phototroph]]ic, although some are [[mixotroph]]ic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by [[osmotrophy]], [[myzocytosis|myzotrophy]], or [[phagocytosis|phagotrophy]]. Some unicellular species of [[green algae]], many [[golden algae]], [[euglenid]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, and other algae have become [[heterotroph]]s (also called colorless or apochlorotic algae), sometimes parasitic, relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim, E.G. 1963.

Algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from [[cyanobacteria]] that produce [[oxygen]] as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as [[Purple sulfur bacteria|purple]] and [[green sulfur bacteria]]. Fossilized filamentous algae from the [[Vindhya]] basin have been dated back to 1.6 to 1.7 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19416859 |year=2009 |last1=Bengtson |first1=S |last2=Belivanova |first2=V |last3=Rasmussen |first3=B |last4=Whitehouse |first4=M |title=The controversial &quot;Cambrian&quot; fossils of the Vindhyan are real but more than a billion years older |volume=106 |issue=19 |pages=7729–34 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812460106 |pmc=2683128 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.7729B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and study==
The singular ''alga'' is the Latin word for &quot;seaweed&quot; and retains that meaning in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=alga, algae|encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged with Seven Language Dictionary|volume=1|year=1986|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology]] is obscure. Although some speculate that it is related to Latin ''algēre'', &quot;be cold&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Eric |last=Partridge |title=algae |encyclopedia=Origins |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature. A more likely source is ''alliga'', &quot;binding, entwining&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=alga|first=Charlton T. |last=Lewis |author2=Charles Short |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1879 |isbn=978-0-19-864201-5 |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?layout.reflang=la;layout.refdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059;layout.reflookup=Alga;layout.refcit=;doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%231812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek]] word for seaweed was φῦκος (''phŷcos''), which could mean either the seaweed (probably red algae) or a red dye derived from it. The Latinization, ''fūcus'', meant primarily the cosmetic rouge. The etymology is uncertain, but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the Biblical פוך (''pūk''), &quot;paint&quot; (if not that word itself), a cosmetic eye-shadow used by the ancient Egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean. It could be any color: black, red, green, or blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Thomas Kelly Cheyne |author2= John Sutherland Black| title = Encyclopædia biblica: a critical dictionary of the literary, political and religious history, the archæology, geography, and natural history of the Bible| url = https://books.google.com/?id=GccVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3525| year = 1902| publisher = Macmillan Company| isbn = | page = 3525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either [[phycology]] or algology, depending on whether the Greek or Latin root is used. The name ''Fucus'' appears in a number of [[taxon|taxa]].

Most algae contain [[chloroplast]]s that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria. Chloroplasts contain circular [[DNA]] like that in cyanobacteria and presumably represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However, the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost plastids entirely.

|These algae have 'primary' [[chloroplast]]s, i.e. the chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event. The chloroplasts of red algae have [[chlorophyll]]s ''a'' and ''c'' (often), and [[phycobilin]]s, while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'' without phycobilins. Land plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them, thus the [[Chlorophyta]] is a sister taxon to the plants; sometimes the Chlorophyta, the [[Charophyta]], and land plants are grouped together as the [[Viridiplantae]].

These groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls ''a'' and ''c'', and phycobilins. The shape varies from plant to plant; they may be of discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral, or ribbon shaped. They have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch. The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts, but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janson |first=Sven |author2=Graneli, Edna |title=Genetic analysis of the psbA gene from single cells indicates a cryptomonad origin of the plastid in Dinophysis (Dinophyceae) |journal=Phycologia |date=September 2003 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=473–477 |publisher=Allen Press Publishing Services |issn=0031-8884 |doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-42-5-473.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first three of these groups (Chromista), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a [[nucleomorph]] in [[cryptomonad]]s, and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor, although other evidence casts doubt on whether the [[heterokont]]s, [[Haptophyta]], and [[cryptomonad]]s are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;parfrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evaluating Support for the Current Classification of Eukaryotic Diversity |authors=Laura Wegener Parfrey, Erika Barbero, Elyse Lasser, Micah Dunthorn, Debashish Bhattacharya, David J Patterson, and Laura A Katz |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020220 |journal=PLoS Genet. |date=December 2006 |volume=2 |issue=12 |pages =e220 |pmid=17194223 |pmc=1713255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Burki F, Shalchian-Tabrizi K, Minge M, Skjæveland Å, Nikolaev SI |year=2007 |title=Phylogenomics Reshuffles the Eukaryotic Supergroups |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=2 |issue=8 |page=e790 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000790 |pmid=17726520 |pmc=1949142 |editor1-last=Butler |editor1-first=Geraldine |bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..790B |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1768, [[Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin]] (1744–1774) published the ''Historia Fucorum'', the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on [[marine biology]] to use the then new binomial nomenclature of Linnaeus. It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Gmelin S G (1768) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=YUAAAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Historia+Fucorum%22&amp;hl=en ''Historia Fucorum''] Ex typographia Academiae scientiarum, St. Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silva PC, Basson PW and Moe RL (1996) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=vuWEemVY8WEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Historia+Fucorum%22+binomial+nomenclature&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en ''Catalogue of the Benthic Marine Algae of the Indian Ocean''] page 2, University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-91581-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers (e.g., [[Otto Friedrich Müller|O. F. Müller]] and [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg|Ehrenberg]]) studying the [[Infusoria]] (microscopic organisms). Unlike [[macroalgae]], which were clearly viewed as plants, [[microalgae]] were frequently considered animals because they are often motile.&lt;ref&gt;Medlin et al. (1997), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the nonmotile (coccoid) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants, macroalgae, or animals.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, A.

Although used as a taxonomic category in some pre-Darwinian classifications, e.g., Linnaeus (1753), de Jussieu (1789), Horaninow (1843), Agassiz (1859), Wilson &amp; Cassin (1864), in further classifications, the &quot;algae&quot; are seen as an artificial, polyphyletic group.

Throughout the 20th century, most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae: [[cyanophyte]]s, [[rhodophyte]]s, [[chrysophyte]]s, [[xanthophyte]]s, [[diatom|bacillariophyte]]s, [[phaeophyte]]s, [[Dinoflagellate#history|pyrrhophyte]]s ([[Cryptomonad|cryptophyte]]s and [[dinophyte]]s), [[euglenophyte]]s, and [[chlorophyte]]s. Later, many new groups were discovered (e.g., [[Bolidophyceae]]), and others were splintered from older groups: [[charophyte]]s and [[glaucophyte]]s (from chlorophytes), many [[heterokontophyte]]s (e.g., [[Synurophyceae|synurophytes]] from chrysophytes, or [[eustigmatophyte]]s from xanthophytes), [[haptophyte]]s (from chrysophytes), and [[chlorarachniophyte]]s (from xanthophytes).

With the abandonment of plant-animal dichotomous classification, most groups of algae (sometimes all) were included in [[Protist]]a, later also abandoned in favour of [[Eukaryota]]. However, as a legacy of the older plant life scheme, some groups that were also treated as [[protozoa]]ns in the past still have duplicated classifications (see [[ambiregnal protist]]s).

Some parasitic algae (e.g., the green algae ''[[Prototheca]]'' and ''[[Helicosporidium]]'', parasites of metazoans, or ''[[Cephaleuros]]'', parasites of plants) were originally classified as [[fungi]], [[sporozoan]]s, or [[protist]]ans of ''[[incertae sedis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=B.

In other cases, some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g., ''[[Chlorochytrium]]''), but later were seen as [[endophytic]] algae.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981). pp.&amp;nbsp;398–400, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rm08AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA398].&lt;/ref&gt; Some filamentous bacteria (e.g., ''[[Beggiatoa]]'') were originally seen as algae. Furthermore, groups like the [[apicomplexan]]s are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids, but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae.

==Relationship to land plants==
The first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like ''[[Chara (alga)|Chara]]'' almost 500 million years ago. These probably had an isomorphic [[alternation of generations]] and were probably filamentous. Fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = When plants conquered land | author = Ivan Noble | date = 18 September 2003 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3117034.stm | publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellman2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wellman, C.H. |author2= Osterloff, P.L.|author3= Mohiuddin, U. | year = 2003| title = Fragments of the earliest land plants| journal = Nature| volume = 425

==Morphology==
[[File:Kelp-forest-Monterey.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[kelp forest]] exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium: A three-dimensional, multicellular thallus]]

A range of algal [[Morphology (biology)|morphologies]] is exhibited, and [[Convergent evolution|convergence]] of features in unrelated groups is common. The only groups to exhibit three-dimensional multicellular [[Thallus|thalli]] are the [[Red algae|reds]] and [[Brown algae|browns]], and some [[Chlorophyta|chlorophytes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Xiao2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Xiao | first1 = S.

Most of the simpler algae are [[unicellular]] [[flagellate]]s or [[amoeboid]]s, but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the [[biological life cycle|lifecycle]] of a species, are
* [[Colony (biology)|Colonial]]: small, regular groups of motile cells
* Capsoid: individual non-motile cells embedded in [[mucilage]]
* Coccoid: individual non-motile cells with cell walls
* Palmelloid: nonmotile cells embedded in mucilage
* Filamentous: a string of nonmotile cells connected together, sometimes branching
* Parenchymatous: cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissues

In three lines, even higher levels of organization have been reached, with full tissue differentiation. These are the brown algae,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/phaeophyta.html|title= Introduction to the Phaeophyta: Kelps and brown &quot;Algae&quot;|first=Ben|last=Waggoner|publisher=University of California Museum of Palaeontology (UCMP)|date=1994–2008|accessdate=19 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221171218/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/phaeophyta.html| archivedate= 21 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;—some of which may reach 50&amp;nbsp;m in length ([[kelp]]s)&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 02&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Thomas| first = D N| title = Seaweeds| year = 2002| publisher = The Natural History Museum| location = London| isbn = 978-0-565-09175-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—the red algae,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/rhodophyta.html |title= Introduction to the Rhodophyta, The red &quot;algae&quot;| first=Ben |last=Waggoner |publisher=University of California Museum of Palaeontology (UCMP) |date=1994–2008 |accessdate=19 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081218211021/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/rhodophyta.html | archivedate= 18 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the green algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/greenalgae/greenalgae.html|title=Introduction to the Green Algae|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most complex forms are found among the green algae (see [[Charales]] and [[Charophyta]]), in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants. The point where these nonalgal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other algal groups.

==Physiology==
Many algae, particularly members of the [[Characeae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tazawa |first=Masashi |title=Sixty Years Research with Characean Cells: Fascinating Material for Plant Cell Biology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iMxH0-q42PkC&amp;pg=PA31 |accessdate=7 October 2012 |volume=72 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-13145-5 |pages=5–34 |journal=Progress in Botany |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-13145-5_1 |series=Progress in Botany}}&lt;/ref&gt; have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes, [[osmoregulation]], [[turgor regulation]], [[salt tolerance]], [[cytoplasmic streaming]], and the generation of [[action potentials]].

[[Phytohormone]]s are found not only in higher plants, but in algae, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tarakhovskaya |first1=E. R. |last2=Maslov |first2=Yu. I. |last3=Shishova |first3=M. F. |date=April 2007 |title=Phytohormones in algae |journal=Russian Journal of Plant Physiology |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=163–170 |doi=10.1134/s1021443707020021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbiotic algae==
Some species of algae form [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]] with other organisms. In these symbioses, the algae supply photosynthates (organic substances) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells. The host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae. Examples are:

===Lichens===
{{Main article|Lichen}}
[[File:Lichens near Clogher Head (stevefe).jpg|thumb|Rock lichens in Ireland]]
[[Lichen]]s are defined by the [[International Association for Lichenology]] to be &quot;an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic [[symbiont]] resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brodo| first = Irwin M| last2 = Sharnoff| first2 = Sylvia Duran| last3 = Sharnoff| first3 = Stephen| last4 = Laurie-Bourque| first4 = Susan| title = Lichens of North America| year = 2001| publisher = Yale University Press| location = New Haven| isbn = 978-0-300-08249-4| page = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi, or mycobionts, are mainly from the [[Ascomycota]] with a few from the [[Basidiomycota]]. They are not found alone in nature; but when they began to associate is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pearson| first = Lorentz C| title = The Diversity and Evolution of Plants| year = 1995| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8493-2483-3| page = 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species, rarely two, from the green algae, except that alternatively, the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria (hence &quot;photobiont&quot; is the more accurate term). A photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently; accordingly, lichens are named and classified as fungal species.&lt;ref&gt;Brodo et al. (2001), page 6: &quot;A species of lichen collected anywhere in its range has the same lichen-forming fungus and, generally, the same photobiont. (A particular photobiont, though, may associate with scores of different lichen fungi).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone (they can be experimentally isolated). The photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont.&lt;ref&gt;Brodo et al. (2001), page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coral reefs===
{{Main article|Coral|Coral reef|Symbiodinium}}
[[File:Coral Reef.jpg|thumb|Floridian coral reef]] [[Coral reef]]s are accumulated from the [[calcareous]] [[exoskeleton]]s of [[marine invertebrate]]s of the order [[Scleractinia]] (stony [[coral]]s). These [[Animal#Food and energy sourcing|animals]] [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[Sugar#Chemistry|sugar]] and oxygen to obtain energy for their cell-building processes, including [[secretion]] of the exoskeleton, with water and [[carbon dioxide]] as byproducts. Dinoflagellates (algal protists) are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coral-forming marine invertebrates, where they accelerate host-cell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host. Reef-building stony corals ([[hermatypic coral]]s) require endosymbiotic algae from the genus ''[[Symbiodinium]]'' to be in a healthy condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Taylor| first = Dennis L| editor-last = Goff| editor-first = Lynda J| title = Algal Symbiosis: A Continuum of Interaction Strategies| year = 1983| publisher = CUP Archive| isbn = 978-0-521-25541-7| pages = 19–20| contribution = The coral-algal symbiosis }}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of ''Symbiodinium'' from the host is known as [[coral bleaching]], a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef.

===Sea sponges===
{{Main article|Sea sponge}}
Green algae live close to the surface of some sponges, for example, breadcrumb sponge (''[[Halichondria panicea]]''). The alga is thus protected from predators; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80% of sponge growth in some species.&lt;ref&gt;http://uwsp.edu/cnr/UWEXlakes/laketides/vol26-4/vol26-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifecycle==
[[Rhodophyta]], [[Chlorophyta]], and [[Heterokontophyta]], the three main algal [[phylum|divisions]], have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity. In general, an asexual phase exists where the seaweed's cells are [[diploid]], a sexual phase where the cells are [[haploid]], followed by fusion of the male and female [[gamete]]s. Asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Commonly, in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae, two specialized, sexually compatible, haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a [[zygote]]. To ensure a successful mating, the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated; pheromones may play a key role in these processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24597605&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frenkel J, Vyverman W, Pohnert G |title=Pheromone signaling during sexual reproduction in algae |journal=Plant J. |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=632–44 |year=2014 |pmid=24597605 |doi=10.1111/tpj.12496 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis, a key stage of the sexual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein and Richard E.

==Numbers==
[[File:Taiwan 2009 East Coast ShihTiPing Giant Stone Steps Algae FRD 6581.jpg|thumb|Algae on coastal rocks at [[:zh:石梯坪|Shihtiping]] in Taiwan]]
The ''Algal Collection of the US National Herbarium'' (located in the [[National Museum of Natural History]]) consists of approximately 320,500 dried specimens, which, although not exhaustive (no exhaustive collection exists), gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species (that number remains unknown).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algae Herbarium|publisher=National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|year=2008|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm|accessdate=19 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112552/http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/herbarium.htm| archivedate= 1 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates vary widely. For example, according to one standard textbook,&lt;ref name=&quot;John 02&quot;&gt;John (2002), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; in the British Isles the ''UK Biodiversity Steering Group Report'' estimated there to be 20,000 algal species in the UK. Another checklist reports only about 5,000 species. Regarding the difference of about 15,000 species, the text concludes: &quot;It will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species&amp;nbsp;...&quot;

Regional and group estimates have been made, as well:

and so on, but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources, these numbers have no more credibility than the British ones mentioned above. Most estimates also omit microscopic algae, such as phytoplankton.

The most recent estimate suggests 72,500 algal species worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guiry | first1 = M.

==Distribution==
The distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of [[phytogeography]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=Round8&gt;{{cite book|author=Round, FE |date=1981 |title=The ecology of algae |chapter= Chapter 8, Dispersal, continuity and phytogeography |pages=357–361 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rm08AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;hl=&amp;pg=PA398#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae spread mainly by the dispersal of [[spore]]s analogously to the dispersal of Plantae by seeds and spores. This dispersal can be accomplished by air, water, or other organisms. Due to this, spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters, air, soil, and in or on other organisms.&lt;ref name=Round8/&gt; Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands.

The spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers.&lt;ref name=Round8/&gt; However, not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae, as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them.&lt;ref name=Round8/&gt; Marine spores are often spread by ocean currents. Ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions, and provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

To some degree, the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as [[Antarctica]], long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is, therefore, possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as &quot;Pacific algae&quot; or &quot;North Sea algae&quot;. When they occur out of their localities, hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible, such as the hulls of ships. For example, ''Ulva reticulata'' and ''U. fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner.

Mapping is possible for select species only: &quot;there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), Page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 371.&lt;/ref&gt; However, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the &quot;difficulties of undertaking such studies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Phytoplankton Lake Chuzenji.jpg|thumb|left|Phytoplankton, [[Lake Chuzenji]]]]
Algae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments, and are found in unusual environments, such as on [[Snow algae|snow]] and [[Ice algae|ice]]. Seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters, under {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep; however, some such as [[Navicula]] pennata have been recorded to a depth of {{convert|360|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Round (1981), page 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology. Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column ([[phytoplankton]]) provide the food base for most marine [[food chain]]s. In very high densities ([[algal bloom]]s), these algae may discolor the water and outcompete, poison, or [[asphyxiate]] other life forms.

Algae can be used as [[indicator organism]]s to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems.&lt;ref name=Omar2010&gt;{{cite journal|title=Perspectives on the Use of Algae as Biological Indicators for Monitoring and Protecting Aquatic Environments, with Special Reference to Malaysian Freshwater Ecosystems |author=Wan Maznah Wan Omar |pmc=3819078 |journal=Trop Life Sci Res |date=Dec 2010 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=51–67 |pmid=24575199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants. Due to this, the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants.&lt;ref name=Omar2010/&gt; To detect these changes, algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease.&lt;ref name=Omar2010/&gt;

On the basis of their habitat, algae can be categorized as: [[Aquatic plant|aquatic]] ([[planktonic]], [[benthic]], [[Marine biology|marine]], [[freshwater]], [[lentic]], [[lotic]]),&lt;ref&gt;Necchi Jr., O.

==Cultural associations==
In [[classical Chinese]], the word {{lang|zh|{{linktext|藻}}}} is used both for &quot;algae&quot; and (in the modest tradition of the [[scholar-official|imperial scholars]]) for &quot;literary talent&quot;. The third island in [[Kunming Lake]] beside the [[Summer Palace]] in Beijing is known as the Zaojian Tang Dao, which thus simultaneously means &quot;Island of the Algae-Viewing Hall&quot; and &quot;Island of the Hall for Reflecting on Literary Talent&quot;.

==Uses==
[[File:Algae Harvester.jpg|thumb|Harvesting algae]]

===Agar===
[[Agar]], a [[gelatin]]ous substance derived from red algae, has a number of commercial uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis ''et al.'' 88&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Lewis| first = J G| last2 = Stanley| first2 = N F| last3 = Guist| first3 = G G| editor-last = Lembi| editor-first = C.A.| editor2-last= Waaland| editor2-first = J.R.| title = Algae and Human Affairs| year = 1988| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-32115-0| contribution = 9 Commercial production of algal hydrocolloides }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi, as most microorganisms cannot digest agar.

===Alginates===
Alginic acid, or alginate, is extracted from brown algae. Its uses range from gelling agents in food, to medical dressings. Alginic acid also has been used in the field of [[biotechnology]] as a [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible medium]] for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization. [[Molecular cuisine]] is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties, by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours.

Between 100,000 and 170,000 wet tons of ''[[Macrocystis]]'' are harvested annually in [[New Mexico]] for [[Alginic acid|alginate]] extraction and [[abalone]] feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algaebase.org/generadetail.lasso?genus_id=35715&amp;-session=abv3:51909EC307dcf25DFApmi3530315|publisher=AlgaeBase|title=Macrocystis C.

===Fertilizer===
{{Details|Seaweed fertiliser}}
[[File:Inishmaan Gardens.jpg|thumb|Seaweed-fertilized gardens on [[Inisheer]]]]
For centuries, seaweed has been used as a fertilizer; [[George Owen of Henllys]] writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in [[South Wales]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England|volume=10|pages=142–143|title=On the Farming of South Wales: Prize Report|first=Clare Sewell|last=Read|authorlink=Clare Sewell Read|year=1849|location=London|publisher=John Murray}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=UJYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22this+kind+of+ore+they+often+gather%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPR4,M1 Downloadable Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of ore they often gather and lay on great heapes, where it heteth and rotteth, and will have a strong and loathsome smell; when being so rotten they cast on the land, as they do their muck, and thereof springeth good corn, especially barley&amp;nbsp;... After spring-tydes or great rigs of the sea, they fetch it in sacks on horse backes, and carie the same three, four, or five miles, and cast it on the lande, which doth very much better the ground for corn and grass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, algae are used by humans in many ways; for example, as [[fertilizer]]s, [[soil conditioner]]s, and livestock feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McHugh| first = Dennis J.| title = A Guide to the Seaweed Industry: FAO Fisheries Technical Paper 441| url = http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/006/Y4765E/y4765e0c.htm#TopOfPage| year = 2003| publisher = Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations| location = Rome| isbn = 978-92-5-104958-7| chapter = 9, Other Uses of Seaweeds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds.

Naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food, especially in Asia. They provide many vitamins including: A, [[Thiamine|B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Riboflavin|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[niacin]], and [[Vitamin C|C]], and are rich in [[iodine]], [[potassium]], iron, [[magnesium]], and [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Simoons| first = Frederick J| title = Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry| year = 1991| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-936923-29-1| pages = 179–190| chapter = 6, Seaweeds and Other Algae }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, commercially cultivated microalgae, including both algae and cyanobacteria, are marketed as nutritional supplements, such as [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm |work=Ethnobotanical Leaflets |title=Modern Uses of Cultivated Algae |publisher=Southern Illinois University Carbondale |first=Steve L |last=Morton |accessdate=26 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223081614/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/algae.htm |archivedate=23 December 2008 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chlorella]]'' and the vitamin-C supplement from ''[[Dunaliella]]'', high in [[beta-carotene]].

[[Agricultural Research Service]] scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from [[manure effluents]] using a horizontal algae scrubber, also called an [[algal turf scrubber]] (ATS). Scientists developed the ATS, which consists of shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Bioremediation===
The alga ''[[Stichococcus bacillaris]]'' has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites; [[Biodegradation|biodegrading]] the synthetic substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Microorganisms Attack Synthetic Polymers in Items Representing Our Cultural Heritage |first1=Francesca |last1=Cappitelli |first2=Claudia |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |year=2008 |volume=74 |pmc=2227722 |last2=Sorlini |issue=3 |pages=564–569 |doi=10.1128/AEM.01768-07 |pmid=18065627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pigments===
The natural [[pigment]]s ([[carotenoid]]s and [[chlorophyll]]s) produced by algae can be used as alternatives to chemical [[dye]]s and coloring agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Arad| first = Shoshana| last2 = Spharim| first2 = Ishai| editor-last = Altman| editor-first = Arie| title = Agricultural Biotechnology| series = Books in Soils, Plants, and the Environment| volume = 61| year = 1998| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8247-9439-2| page = 638| contribution = Production of Valuable Products from Microalgae: An Emerging Agroindustry }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of some individual algal pigments, together with specific pigment concentration ratios, are taxon-specific: analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods, particularly [[high-performance liquid chromatography]], can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural alga populations in sea water samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C.

'''Analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of [[statistical model]]s used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures (such as &quot;variation&quot; among and between groups), developed by [[statistician]] and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Ronald Fisher]]. In the ANOVA setting, the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a [[statistical test]] of whether or not the [[mean]]s of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the [[Student's t-test#Independent two-sample t-test|''t''-test]] to more than two groups.   ANOVAs are useful for comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for [[statistical significance]].  It is conceptually similar to [[Multiple comparisons problem|multiple two-sample t-tests]], but is more conservative (results in less [[type I error]]){{citation needed|date=August 2017}} and is therefore suited to a wide range of practical problems.

==History==
While the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century, antecedents extend centuries into the past according to Stigler.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;  These include hypothesis testing, the partitioning of sums of squares, experimental techniques and the additive model. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 134)&lt;/ref&gt; The development of least-squares methods by Laplace and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining observations (over the existing practices then used in astronomy and geodesy). It also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares. Laplace soon knew how to estimate a variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum of squares.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 153)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1827 Laplace was using least squares methods to address ANOVA problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;154–155)&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting 
from reaction times (the &quot;[[personal equation]]&quot;) and had developed methods of reducing the errors.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;240–242)&lt;/ref&gt;  The experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology &lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, 
Chapter 7 - Psychophysics as a Counterpoint)&lt;/ref&gt; which developed strong (full factorial) experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, p 253)&lt;/ref&gt;  An eloquent non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was
available in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler (1986, pp&amp;nbsp;314–315)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Fisher]] introduced the term [[variance]] and proposed its formal analysis in a 1918 article ''[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance''. Ronald A. Fisher. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh''. 1918. (volume 52, pages 399–433)&lt;/ref&gt;  His first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;On the &quot;Probable Error&quot; of a Coefficient of Correlation Deduced from a Small Sample. Ronald A. Fisher. Metron, 1: 3-32 (1921)&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of variance became widely known after being included in Fisher's 1925 book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]''.

Randomization models were developed by several researchers.  The first was published in Polish by [[Neyman]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffé (1959, p 291, &quot;Randomization models were first formulated by 
Neyman (1923) for the completely randomized design, by Neyman (1935) for randomized blocks, by Welch (1937) and Pitman (1937) for the Latin square under a certain null hypothesis, and by Kempthorne (1952, 1955) and Wilk (1955) for many other designs.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the attributes of ANOVA which ensured its early popularity was computational elegance.  The structure of the additive model allows solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than by matrix calculations.  In the era of mechanical calculators this simplicity was critical.  The determination of statistical significance also required access to tables of the F function which were supplied by early statistics texts.

==Motivating example==
[[File:Anova, no fit..png|thumb|No fit.]][[File:ANOVA fair fit.jpg|thumb|Fair fit]][[File:ANOVA very good fit.jpg|thumb|Very good fit]]The analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations.  A dog show provides an example.  A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed: it is typically limited to dogs that are adult, pure-bred, and exemplary.  A histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex, like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations.  Suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog. Before we could do that, we would need to ''explain'' the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics. A successful grouping will split dogs such that (a) each group has a low variance of dog weights (meaning the group is relatively homogeneous) and (b) the mean of each group is distinct (if two groups have the same mean, then it isn't reasonable to conclude that the groups are, in fact, separate in any meaningful way).
In the illustrations to the right, each group is identified as ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. In the first illustration, we divide the dogs according to the product (interaction) of two binary groupings: young vs old, and short-haired vs long-haired (thus, group 1 is young, short-haired dogs, group 2 is young, long-haired dogs, etc.). Since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups (shown in blue) has a large variance, and since the means are very close across groups, grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights: knowing which group a dog is in does not allow us to make any reasonable statements as to what that dog's weight is likely to be. Thus, this grouping fails to ''fit'' the distribution we are trying to explain (yellow-orange).

An attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as (pet vs working breed) and (less athletic vs more athletic) would probably be somewhat more successful (fair fit).  The heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds, while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter.  As shown by the second illustration, the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case, and the means are more reasonably distinguishable. However, the significant overlap of distributions, for example, means that we cannot reliably say that ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are truly distinct (i.e., it is perhaps reasonably likely that splitting dogs according to the flip of a coin—by pure chance—might produce distributions that look similar).

An attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit.  All Chihuahuas are light and all St Bernards are heavy.  The difference in weights between Setters and Pointers does not justify separate breeds.  The analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments.  A common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models.  The method has some advantages over correlation: not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship.

==Background and terminology==
ANOVA is a particular form of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] heavily used in the analysis of experimental data.  A test  result (calculated from the [[null hypothesis]] and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance, ''assuming the truth of the null hypothesis''. A statistically significant result, when a probability ([[p-value]]) is less than a threshold (significance level), justifies the rejection of the [[null hypothesis]], but only if the priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high.

In the typical application of ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population. For example, when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients, the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none). Rejecting the null hypothesis would imply that different treatments result in altered effects.

By construction, hypothesis testing limits the rate of [[Type I errors]] (false positives) to a significance level.  Experimenters also wish to limit [[Type II errors]] (false negatives).  
The rate of Type II errors depends largely on sample size (the rate will increase for small numbers of samples), significance 
level (when the standard of proof is high, the chances of overlooking 
a discovery are also high) and [[effect size]] (a smaller effect size is more prone to Type II error).

The terminology of ANOVA is largely from the statistical 
[[design of experiments]].  The experimenter adjusts factors and 
measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect.  Factors are 
assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and 
[[Randomized block design|blocking]] to ensure the validity of the results.  [[Blind experiment|Blinding]] keeps the
weighing impartial.  Responses show a variability that is partially 
the result of the effect and is partially random error.

ANOVA is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple 
purposes.  As a consequence, it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.

&quot;Classical ANOVA for balanced data does three things at once:
{{ordered list|start=1
| As [[exploratory data analysis]], an ANOVA is an organization of an additive data decomposition, and its sums of squares indicate the variance of each component of the decomposition (or, equivalently, each set of terms of a linear model).
| Comparisons of mean squares, along with an [[F-test]]&amp;nbsp;... allow testing of a nested sequence of models.
| Closely related to the ANOVA is a linear model fit with coefficient estimates and standard errors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p 2)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
In short, ANOVA is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data.

Additionally:
{{ordered list|start=4
| It is computationally elegant and relatively robust against violations of its assumptions.
| ANOVA provides industrial strength (multiple sample comparison) statistical analysis.
| It has been adapted to the analysis of a variety of experimental designs.
}}
As a result:
ANOVA &quot;has long enjoyed the status of being the '''most used''' (some would 
say abused) statistical technique in psychological research.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Howell (2002, p 320)&lt;/ref&gt;
ANOVA &quot;is probably the '''most useful''' technique in the field of 
statistical inference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, p 63)&lt;/ref&gt;

ANOVA is difficult to teach, particularly for complex experiments, with [[Restricted randomization|split-plot designs]] being notorious.&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p 1)&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases the proper 
application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition 
followed by the consultation of a classic authoritative test.&lt;ref&gt;
Gelman (2005, p 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design-of-experiments terms===

; Balanced design: An experimental design where all cells (i.e. treatment combinations) have the same number of observations.
; Blocking: A schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials, operators, machines, etc., become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable. The reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects. Blocking is achieved by restricting randomization.
; Design: A set of experimental runs which allows the fit of a particular model and the estimate of effects.
; DOE: Design of experiments.  An approach to problem solving involving collection of data that will support valid, defensible, and supportable conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

; Effect: How changing the settings of a factor changes the response. The effect of a single factor is also called a main effect.
; Error: Unexplained variation in a collection of observations. DOE's typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error.
; Experimental unit: The entity to which a specific treatment combination is applied.
; Factors: Process inputs that an investigator manipulates to cause a change in the output.
; Lack-of-fit error: Error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model. Including replication in a DOE allows separation of experimental error into its components: lack of fit and random (pure) error.
; Model: Mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors.
; Random error: Error that occurs due to natural variation in the process. Random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance. Random error is also called experimental error.
; Randomization: A schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a DOE such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Randomization is a term used in multiple ways in this
material.  &quot;Randomization has three roles in applications: as a device 
for eliminating biases, for example from unobserved explanatory 
variables and selection effects: as a basis for estimating standard 
errors: and as a foundation for formally exact significance tests.&quot;  
Cox (2006, page 192)  Hinkelmann and Kempthorne use randomization 
both in experimental design and for statistical analysis.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Replication: Performing the same treatment combination more than once. Including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error.
; Responses: The output(s) of a process. Sometimes called dependent variable(s).
; Treatment: A treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments.

== Classes of models ==
There are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance, and these are outlined here.

===Fixed-effects models===
{{Main|Fixed effects model}}
The fixed-effects model (class I) of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the [[response variable]] values change. This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole.

===Random-effects models===
{{Main|Random effects model}}
Random effects model (class II) is used when the treatments are not fixed. This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population. Because the levels themselves are [[random variable]]s, some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments (a multi-variable generalization of simple differences) differ from the fixed-effects model.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Chapter 12: Experiments with random factors)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed-effects models===
{{Main|Mixed model}}
A mixed-effects model (class III) contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types, with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types.

Example:
Teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department 
to find a good introductory textbook, with each text considered a 
treatment.  The fixed-effects model would compare a list of candidate 
texts.  The random-effects model would determine whether important 
differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts.  The 
mixed-effects model would compare the (fixed) incumbent texts to 
randomly selected alternatives.

Defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive, with competing 
definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire.&lt;ref&gt;
Gelman (2005, pp. 20–21)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assumptions==
The analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches, the most common of which uses a [[linear model]] that relates the response to the treatments and blocks. Note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels. Interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data.

===Textbook analysis using a normal distribution===
The analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a [[linear model]], which makes the following assumptions about the [[probability distribution]] of the responses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Statistical Methods

* [[Statistical independence|Independence]] of observations &amp;ndash; this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis.
* [[normal distribution|Normality]] &amp;ndash; the distributions of the [[Residual (statistics)|residuals]] are [[Normal distribution|normal]].
* Equality (or &quot;homogeneity&quot;) of variances, called [[homoscedasticity]] &amp;mdash; the variance of data in groups should be the same.

The separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the [[errors and residuals in statistics|errors]] are independently, identically, and normally distributed for fixed effects models, that is, that the errors (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;) are independent and

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2).\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Randomization-based analysis===
{{See also|Random assignment|Randomization test}}
In a [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled experiment]], the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units, following the experimental protocol. This randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out. The objective random-assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis, following the ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] and [[Ronald Fisher]]. This design-based analysis was discussed and developed by [[Francis J. Anscombe]] at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] and by [[Oscar Kempthorne]] at [[Iowa State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Anscombe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'', which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and [[David R. Cox]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

====Unit-treatment additivity====
In its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Unit-treatment additivity is simply termed additivity
in most texts.  Hinkelmann and Kempthorne add adjectives and
distinguish between additivity in the strict and broad senses.  This 
allows a detailed consideration of multiple error sources (treatment, 
state, selection, measurement and sampling) on page 161.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the observed response &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; from experimental unit &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; when receiving treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; can be written as the sum of the unit's response &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and the treatment-effect &lt;math&gt; t_j&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;ref&gt;Kempthorne (1979, p 30)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot;&gt;Cox (1958, Chapter 2: Some Key Assumptions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Throughout.  Introduced in Section 2.3.3: Principles of experimental design; The linear model; Outline of a model)&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;y_{i,j}=y_i+t_j.&lt;/math&gt;
The assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that, for every treatment &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;th treatment has  exactly the same effect &lt;math&gt;t_j&lt;/math&gt; on every experiment unit.

The assumption of unit treatment additivity  usually cannot be directly [[falsificationism|falsified]], according to Cox and Kempthorne. However, many ''consequences'' of treatment-unit additivity can be falsified. For a randomized experiment, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity ''implies'' that the variance is constant for all treatments. Therefore, by [[contraposition]], a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.

The use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population [[survey sampling]].

====Derived linear model====
Kempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'' to produce a ''derived linear model'', very similar to the textbook model discussed previously.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.3: 
Completely Randomized Design; Derived Linear Model)&lt;/ref&gt;  The test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model, according to approximation theorems and simulation studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinkelmannKempthorne&quot;&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.6: Completely randomized design; Approximating the randomization test)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences. For example, the randomization-based analysis results in a small but (strictly) negative correlation between the observations.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (2008, Chapter 2.14 &quot;A More General Model&quot; in Bailey, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–40)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Chapter 7: Comparison of Treatments)&lt;/ref&gt; In the randomization-based analysis, there is ''no assumption'' of a ''normal'' distribution and certainly ''no assumption'' of ''independence''. On the contrary, ''the observations are dependent''!

The randomization-based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time.  Since the randomization-based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model, most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach. Few statisticians object to model-based analysis of balanced randomized experiments.

====Statistical models for observational data====
However, when applied to data from non-randomized experiments or [[observational study|observational studies]], model-based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization.&lt;ref&gt;
Kempthorne (1979, pp 125–126, 
&quot;The experimenter must decide which of the various causes that he 
feels will produce variations in his results must be controlled 
experimentally.  Those causes that he does not control experimentally, 
because he is not cognizant of them, he must control by the device of 
randomization.&quot;  &quot;[O]nly when the treatments in the experiment are 
applied by the experimenter using the full randomization procedure is 
the chain of inductive inference sound.  It is ''only'' under these 
circumstances that the experimenter can attribute whatever effects he 
observes to the treatment and the treatment only.  Under these 
circumstances his conclusions are reliable in the statistical sense.&quot;)  
&lt;/ref&gt; For observational data, the derivation of confidence intervals must use ''subjective'' models, as emphasized by [[Ronald Fisher]] and his followers. In practice, the estimates of treatment-effects from observational studies  generally are often inconsistent.  In practice, &quot;statistical models&quot; and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary of assumptions===
The normal-model based ANOVA analysis assumes the independence, normality and 
homogeneity of the variances of the residuals. The 
randomization-based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the 
variances of the residuals (as a consequence of unit-treatment 
additivity) and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment. 
Both these analyses require [[homoscedasticity]], as an assumption for the normal-model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based analysis.

However, studies of processes that 
change variances rather than means (called dispersion effects) have 
been successfully conducted using ANOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery 
(2001, Section 3.8: Discovering dispersion effects)&lt;/ref&gt;  There are
''no'' necessary assumptions for ANOVA in its full generality, but the
F-test used for ANOVA hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical 
limitations which are of continuing interest.

Problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of ANOVA can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions. 
The property of unit-treatment additivity is not invariant under a &quot;change of scale&quot;, so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity. If the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions, then the statistician may specify (in the protocol for the experiment or observational study) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.10: Completely randomized design; Transformations)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses, which are believed to follow a multiplicative model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Cauchy's [[functional equation]] theorem, the [[logarithm]] is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Characteristics==
ANOVA is used in the analysis of comparative experiments, those in 
which only the difference in outcomes is of interest.  The statistical
significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two 
variances.  This ratio is independent of several possible alterations
to the experimental observations: Adding a constant to all 
observations does not alter significance.  Multiplying all 
observations by a constant does not alter significance.  So ANOVA 
statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and 
scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations.  
In the era of mechanical calculation it was common to 
subtract a constant from all observations (when equivalent to 
dropping leading digits) to simplify data entry.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery 
(2001, Section 3-3: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis of 
variance; Analysis of the fixed effects model)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 2 example)&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an example of data
[[Coding (social sciences)|coding]].

==Logic==
The calculations of ANOVA can be characterized as computing a number
of means and variances, dividing two variances and comparing the ratio 
to a handbook value to determine statistical significance.  Calculating 
a treatment effect is then trivial, &quot;the effect of any treatment is 
estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the 
observations which receive the treatment and the general mean&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Cochran &amp; Cox (1992, p 49)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partitioning of the sum of squares===
{{main|Partition of sums of squares}}
ANOVA uses traditional standardized terminology.  The definitional 
equation of sample variance is
&lt;math&gt;s^2=\textstyle\frac{1}{n-1}\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2&lt;/math&gt;, where the 
divisor is called the degrees of freedom (DF), the summation is called 
the sum of squares (SS), the result is called the mean square (MS) and 
the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean.  ANOVA 
estimates 3 sample variances: a total variance based on all the 
observation deviations from the grand mean, an error variance based on 
all the observation deviations from their appropriate 
treatment means, and a treatment variance.  The treatment variance is
based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean, the 
result being multiplied by the number of observations in each 
treatment to account for the difference between the variance of 
observations and the variance of means.

The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total [[sum of squares (statistics)|sum of squares]] ''SS'' into components related to the effects used in the model. For example, the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels.

:&lt;math&gt;SS_\text{Total} = SS_\text{Error} + SS_\text{Treatments}&lt;/math&gt;

The number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] ''DF'' can be partitioned in a similar way: one of these components (that for error) specifies a [[chi-squared distribution]] which describes the associated sum of squares, while the same is true for &quot;treatments&quot; if there is no treatment effect.

:&lt;math&gt;DF_\text{Total} = DF_\text{Error} + DF_\text{Treatments}&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Lack-of-fit sum of squares]].

===The F-test===
{{Main|F-test}}
The [[F-test]] is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation. For example, in one-way, or single-factor ANOVA, statistical significance is tested for by comparing the F test statistic

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{\text{variance between treatments}}{\text{variance within treatments}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{MS_\text{Treatments}}{MS_\text{Error}} = {{SS_\text{Treatments} / (I-1)} \over {SS_\text{Error} / (n_T-I)}}&lt;/math&gt;
where  ''MS'' is mean square, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  = number of treatments and 
&lt;math&gt;n_T&lt;/math&gt; = total number of cases

to the [[F-distribution]] with &lt;math&gt;I - 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n_T - I&lt;/math&gt;  degrees of freedom. Using the [[F-distribution]] is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled [[chi-squared distribution]].

The expected value of F is &lt;math&gt;1 + {n \sigma^2_\text{Treatment}} / 
{\sigma^2_\text{Error}}&lt;/math&gt; (where n is the treatment sample size)
which is 1 for no treatment effect.  As values of F increase above 1, the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis. Two apparent experimental methods of increasing F are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls.

There are two methods of concluding the ANOVA hypothesis test, both of which produce the same result:
* The textbook method is to compare the observed value of F with the critical value of F determined from tables. The critical value of F is a function of the degrees of freedom of the numerator and the denominator and the significance level (α).  If F ≥ F&lt;sub&gt;Critical&lt;/sub&gt;, the null hypothesis is rejected.
* The computer method calculates the probability (p-value) of a value of F greater than or equal to the observed value.  The null hypothesis is rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance level (α).
The ANOVA F-test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors (i.e. maximizing power for a fixed significance level). For example, to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect, the [[F-test]]'s p-values closely approximate the [[permutation test]]'s [[p-value]]s: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinkelmannKempthorne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.7: Completely randomized design; CRD with unequal numbers of replications)&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[permutation test]]s characterize [[uniformly most powerful test|tests with maximum power]] against all [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], as observed by Rosenbaum.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Rosenbaum (2002, page 40) cites Section 5.7 (Permutation Tests), Theorem 2.3 (actually Theorem 3, page 184) of [[Erich Leo Lehmann|Lehmann]]'s ''Testing Statistical Hypotheses'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; The ANOVA F–test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions.&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, page 763)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The F-test for the comparison of variances has a mixed reputation.  It 
is not recommended as a hypothesis test to determine whether two 
''different'' samples have the same variance.  It is recommended for 
ANOVA where two estimates of the variance of the ''same'' 
sample are compared.  While the F-test is not generally robust against 
departures from normality, it has been found to be robust in the 
special case of ANOVA.  Citations from Moore &amp; McCabe (2003): 
&quot;Analysis of variance uses F statistics, but these are not 
the same as the F statistic for comparing two population standard 
deviations.&quot; (page 554) &quot;The F test and other procedures for inference 
about variances are so lacking in robustness as to be of little use in 
practice.&quot; (page 556)  &quot;[The ANOVA F test] is relatively insensitive 
to moderate nonnormality and unequal variances, especially when the 
sample sizes are similar.&quot; (page 763)  ANOVA assumes homoscedasticity, 
but it is robust.  The statistical test for homoscedasticity (the 
F-test) is not robust.  Moore &amp; McCabe recommend a rule of thumb.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended logic===
ANOVA consists of separable parts; partitioning sources of variance 
and hypothesis testing can be used individually.  ANOVA is used to 
support other statistical tools.  Regression is first used to fit more 
complex models to data, then ANOVA is used to compare models with the 
objective of selecting simple(r) models that adequately describe the 
data.  &quot;Such models could be fit without any reference to ANOVA, but 
ANOVA tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models, 
and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot;&gt;Gelman (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  
&quot;[W]e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring 
multilevel models—not as an alternative to regression but as a tool 
for summarizing complex high-dimensional inferences&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot; /&gt;

==For a single factor==
{{Main|One-way analysis of variance}}
The simplest experiment suitable for ANOVA analysis is the completely 
randomized experiment with a single factor.  More complex experiments 
with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include 
completely randomized blocks and Latin squares (and variants: 
Graeco-Latin squares, etc.).  The more complex experiments share many 
of the complexities of multiple factors.  A relatively complete 
discussion of the analysis (models, data summaries, ANOVA table) of 
the completely randomized experiment is 
[[One-way analysis of variance|available]].

==For multiple factors==
{{Main|Two-way analysis of variance}}
ANOVA generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors.  
When the experiment includes observations at all combinations of 
levels of each factor, it is termed [[Factorial experiment|factorial]].  
Factorial experiments 
are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the 
efficiency grows as the number of factors increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montgomery&quot;&gt;Montgomery 
(2001, Section 5-2: Introduction to factorial designs; The advantages 
of factorials)&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, factorial designs are heavily used.

The use of ANOVA to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication.  In a 3-way ANOVA with factors x, y and z, the ANOVA model includes terms for the main effects (x, y, z) and terms for [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] (xy, xz, yz, xyz).  
All terms require hypothesis tests.  The proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance. Fortunately, experience says that high order interactions are rare.&lt;ref&gt;Belle (2008, Section 8.4: High-order interactions occur rarely)&lt;/ref&gt;   {{verify source|date=December 2014}}
The ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple 
factor ANOVA.  Testing one factor at a time hides interactions, but 
produces apparently inconsistent experimental results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montgomery&quot; /&gt;

Caution is advised when encountering interactions; Test  
interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond ANOVA if 
interactions are found.  Texts vary in their recommendations regarding 
the continuation of the ANOVA procedure after encountering an 
interaction.  Interactions complicate the interpretation of 
experimental data.  Neither the calculations of significance nor the 
estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value.  &quot;A 
significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 5-1: Introduction to factorial designs; Basic definitions and principles)&lt;/ref&gt;  Graphical methods are recommended
to enhance understanding.  Regression is often useful.  A lengthy discussion of interactions is available in Cox (1958).&lt;ref&gt;Cox (1958, 
Chapter 6: Basic ideas about factorial experiments)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some interactions can be removed (by transformations) while others cannot.

A variety of techniques are used with multiple factor ANOVA to reduce expense. One technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication (possibly no replication with support of [[Tukey's test of additivity|analytical trickery]]) and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically (or practically) insignificant.  An experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 5-3.7: Introduction to factorial designs; The two-factor factorial design; One observation per cell)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worked numeric examples==
Several fully worked numerical examples are available.  A 
[[F-test#One-way ANOVA example|simple case]] uses one-way (a single factor) analysis.  A [[Two-way analysis of variance|more complex case]] uses two-way (two-factor) analysis.

==Associated analysis==
Some analysis is required in support of the ''design'' of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses.  Because experimentation is iterative, the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments.

===Preparatory analysis===

====The number of experimental units====

In the design of an experiment, the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment. Experimentation is often sequential.

Early experiments are often designed to provide mean-unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error. Later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude; in this case, the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power, among other goals.

Reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology. &quot;Provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 596)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis, which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted, is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards.

Besides the power analysis, there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units. These include graphical methods based on limiting
the probability of false negative errors, graphical methods based on an expected variation increase (above the residuals) and methods based on achieving a desired confident interval.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-7: Determining sample size)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power analysis====
[[Statistical power|Power analysis]] is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and significance level. Power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 8: Power)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Section 11.12: Power (in ANOVA))&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Section 13.7: Power analysis for factorial experiments)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, pp 778–780)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effect size====
{{Main|Effect size}}
Several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for ANOVA to summarize the strength of the association between a predictor(s) and the dependent variable (e.g., &amp;eta;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or &amp;fnof;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or the overall standardized difference (&amp;Psi;) of the complete model. Standardized effect-size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines.  However, while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature, a non-standardized measure of effect size that has immediately &quot;meaningful&quot; units may be preferable for reporting purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot;&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 599)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Follow-up analysis===
It is always appropriate to carefully consider outliers.  They have a disproportionate impact on statistical conclusions and are often the result of errors.

====Model confirmation====
It is prudent to verify that the assumptions of ANOVA have been met. Residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm [[homoscedasticity]] and gross normality.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-4: Model adequacy checking)&lt;/ref&gt;  Residuals should have the appearance of (zero mean normal distribution) noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and 
modeled data values. Trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations.  One rule of thumb: &quot;If the largest standard deviation is less than twice the smallest standard deviation, we can use methods based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results 
will still be approximately correct.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and McCabe (2003, p 755, Qualifications to this rule appear in a footnote.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Follow-up tests====
A statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often followed up with one or more different follow-up tests. This can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses. Follow-up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned ([[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]) or [[Post-hoc analysis|post hoc]]. Planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data.

Often one of the &quot;treatments&quot; is none, so the treatment group can act as a control.  [[Dunnett's test]] (a modification of the t-test) tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the same 
mean as the control.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5.8: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis of 
variance; Practical interpretation of results; Comparing means with a control)&lt;/ref&gt;

Post hoc tests such as [[Tukey's range test]] most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for Type I errors. Comparisons, which are most commonly planned, can be either simple or compound. Simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean. Compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups (e.g., compare average group means of group A, B and C with group D). Comparisons can also look at tests of trend, such as linear and quadratic relationships, when the independent variable involves ordered levels.

Following ANOVA with pair-wise multiple-comparison tests has been criticized on several grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 7.5: 
Comparison of Treatments; Multiple Comparison Procedures)&lt;/ref&gt; There are many such tests (10 in one table) and recommendations regarding their use are vague or conflicting.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 12: Multiple comparisons among treatment means)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5: Practical interpretation of results)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study designs==
There are several types of ANOVA. Many statisticians base ANOVA on the [[experimental design|design of the experiment]],&lt;ref&gt;Cochran &amp; Cox (1957, p 9,
&quot;[T]he general rule [is] that the way in which the experiment is conducted determines not only whether inferences can be made, but also the calculations required to make them.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; especially on the protocol that specifies the [[random assignment]] of treatments to subjects; the protocol's description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]]. It is also common to apply ANOVA to observational data using an appropriate statistical model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Some popular designs use the following types of ANOVA:
*[[One-way ANOVA]] is used to test for differences among two or more [[statistical independence|independent]] groups (means),e.g. different levels of urea application in a crop, or different levels of antibiotic action on several bacterial species,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedicalstatistics.info/en/multiplegroups/one-way-anova.html One-way/single factor ANOVA. Biomedical Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107211953/http://www.biomedicalstatistics.info/en/multiplegroups/one-way-anova.html |date=7 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or different levels of effect of some medicine on groups of patients. Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a [[t-test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Cautions==
Balanced experiments (those with an equal sample size for each treatment) are relatively easy to interpret; Unbalanced 
experiments offer more complexity.  For single factor (one way) ANOVA, the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy, but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-3.4: Unbalanced data)&lt;/ref&gt;  For more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications. &quot;The orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case. This means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply.  
Consequently, the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 14-2: Unbalanced data in factorial design)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the general case, &quot;The analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data, but then the sums of squares, mean squares, and F-ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation 
are considered.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gelman&quot; /&gt;  The simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data.  More complex techniques use regression.

ANOVA is (in part) a significance test.  The American Psychological Association holds the view that simply reporting significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilkinson&quot; /&gt;

While ANOVA is conservative (in maintaining a significance level) against [[multiple comparisons]] in one dimension, it is not conservative against comparisons in multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson (1999, p 600)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
ANOVA is considered to be a special case of [[linear regression]]&lt;ref&gt;Gelman (2005, p.1) (with qualification in the later text)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3.9: The Regression Approach to the Analysis of Variance)&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn is a special case of the [[general linear model]].&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, p 604)&lt;/ref&gt; All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a residual (error) to be minimized.

The [[Kruskal&amp;ndash;Wallis test]] and the [[Friedman test]] are [[nonparametric]] tests, which  do not rely on an assumption of normality.&lt;ref&gt;Howell (2002, Chapter 18: Resampling and nonparametric approaches to data)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery (2001, Section 3-10: Nonparametric methods in the analysis of variance)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection to linear regression===
Below we make clear the connection between multi-way ANOVA and linear regression. Linearly re-order the data so that &lt;math&gt;k^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; observation is associated with a response &lt;math&gt;y_k&lt;/math&gt; and factors &lt;math&gt;Z_{k,b}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;b \in \{1,2,\ldots,B\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the different factors and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of factors. In one-way ANOVA &lt;math&gt;B=1&lt;/math&gt; and in two-way ANOVA &lt;math&gt;B=2&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, we assume the &lt;math&gt;b^{th}&lt;/math&gt; factor has &lt;math&gt;I_b&lt;/math&gt; levels. Now, we can [[one-hot]] encode the factors into the &lt;math&gt; \prod_{b=1}^B I_b&lt;/math&gt; dimensional vector &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt;.

The one-hot encoding function &lt;math&gt;g_b : I_b \mapsto \{0,1\}^{I_b}&lt;/math&gt; is defined such that the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; entry of &lt;math&gt;g_b(Z_{k,b})&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;
g_b(Z_{k,b})_i = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } i=Z_{k,b} \\
 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
The vector &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;v_k = [g_1(Z_{k,1}), g_2(Z_{k,2}), \ldots, g_B(Z_{k,B})]&lt;/math&gt;. In order to obtain a fully general &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;-way interaction ANOVA we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; and then add an intercept term.  Let that vector be &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;.

With this notation in place, we now have the exact connection with linear regression. We simply regress response &lt;math&gt;y_k&lt;/math&gt; against the vector &lt;math&gt;X_k&lt;/math&gt;. However, there is a concern about identifiability. In order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero. From here, one can use F-statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors.

====Example====
We can consider the 2-way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels.

Define &lt;math&gt;a_i = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;Z_{k,1}=i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_i = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;Z_{k,2}=i&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the one-hot encoding of the first factor and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the one-hot encoding of the second factor.

With that,
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;
X_k = [a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,b_3,a_1 \times b_1,a_1 \times b_2, a_1 \times b_3, a_2 \times b_1, a_2 \times b_2, a_2 \times b_3,1]
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last term is an intercept term. For a more concrete example suppose that
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{k,1} &amp; = 2 \\
Z_{k,2} &amp; = 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then,
&lt;math display=&quot;block&quot;&gt;
X_k = [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of [[methane]], the simplest alkane]]

In [[organic chemistry]], an '''alkane''', or '''paraffin''' (a historical name that also has [[paraffin (disambiguation)|other meanings]]), is an [[open-chain compound|acyclic]] [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] [[hydrocarbon]]. In other words, an alkane consists of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] atoms arranged in a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] structure in which all the [[C-C bond|carbon-carbon bonds]] are [[single bond|single]].&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam-webster&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00222.html|title=Alkane - Definition  from the ''Compendium of Chemical Terminology''|publisher=iupac.org|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkanes have the general chemical formula {{Carbon}}&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;{{Hydrogen}}&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt;. The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of [[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large molecules.  

Besides this standard definition by [[IUPAC|the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]], in some authors' usage the term ''alkane'' is applied to any saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the [[cycloalkane]]s) or polycyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Hydrocarbons/Alkanes|title=Alkanes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an alkane, each carbon atom has 4 bonds (either C-C or [[C-H bond|C-H]]), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (so in a C-H bond). The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its [[skeletal formula|carbon skeleton]] or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms may be thought of as the size of the alkane.

One group of the [[higher alkanes]] are [[wax]]es, solids at '''standard [[ambient temperature]] and pressure''' ('''SATP'''), for which the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17.

With their repeated -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- units, the alkanes constitute a [[homologous series]] of organic compounds in which the members differ in [[molecular mass]] by multiples of 14.03&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (the total mass of each such [[methylene bridge|methylene-bridge]] unit, which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12.01&amp;nbsp;u and two hydrogen atoms of mass ~1.01&amp;nbsp;u each).

Alkanes are not very reactive and have little [[biological activity]]. They can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active/reactive [[functional groups]] of biological molecules.

The alkanes have two main commercial sources: [[petroleum]] (crude oil)&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Hydrocarbons (Alkanes, Alkenes And Alkynes)|author =Arora, A.|date=2006|publisher=Discovery Publishing House Pvt. Limited|isbn=9788183561426|url=http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=_4vfMv7aP3EC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[natural gas]].

An '''[[alkyl]] group''', generally abbreviated with the symbol R, is a functional group that, like an alkane, consists solely of single-bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms connected acyclically—for example, a [[methyl]] or [[ethyl group]].

==Structure classification==

Saturated hydrocarbons are [[hydrocarbon]]s having only single covalent bonds between their carbons. They can be:
* linear (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''+2}}) wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snake-like structure
* branched (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''+2}}, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2) wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions
* [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]] (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''}}, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3) wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop.

According to the definition by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called [[cycloalkane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title=alkanes | file = A00222 | date = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures; the general formula is  {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''−2''k''+2}}, where ''k'' is the number of independent loops. Alkanes are the [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] (loopless) ones, corresponding to ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Isomerism==
[[Image:Saturated C4 hydrocarbons ball-and-stick.png|thumb|right| Different C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes and cycloalkanes (left to right): [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]] are the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; isomers; [[cyclobutane]] and [[methylcyclopropane]] are the two C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; isomers.&lt;br /&gt; Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane is the only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compound and has no isomer; [[tetrahedrane]] (below) is the only C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compound and also has no isomer.]]

[[File:Tetrahedrane-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|100px|[[Tetrahedrane]] ]]

Alkanes with more than three [[carbon]] atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming [[structural isomer]]s. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the ''n''-isomer (''n'' for &quot;normal&quot;, although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms. For example:&lt;ref name= OEIS &gt;[[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] {{OEIS|id=A000602}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: [[methane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: [[ethane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: [[propane]] only
* C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: 2 isomers: [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;: 3 isomers: [[pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]]
* C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 isomers: [[hexane]], [[2-Methylpentane|2-methylpentane]], [[3-Methylpentane|3-methylpentane]], [[2,2-Dimethylbutane|2,2-dimethylbutane]], and [[2,3-Dimethylbutane|2,3-dimethylbutane]]

Branched alkanes can be [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]. For example, [[3-methylhexane]] and its higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]] are chiral due to their [[stereogenic center]] at carbon atom number 3. In addition to the alkane isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called [[cycloalkane]]s.

==Nomenclature==
{{Main article|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}
The [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Alkanes|IUPAC nomenclature]] (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains. Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix &quot;-ane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_184.htm | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | chapter = R-2.2.1: Hydrocarbons | author = IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry | title = A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (Recommendations 1993) | year = 1993 | publisher = Blackwell Scientific | isbn = 0-632-03488-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the [[hydrocarbons]]  C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''−6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html Alkane Nomenclature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202091842/http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html |date=2 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds;&lt;ref&gt;Thus, the ending &quot;-diene&quot; is applied in some cases where von Hofmann had &quot;-ine&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;-one&quot; represents a [[ketone]]; &quot;-ol&quot; represents an alcohol or OH group; &quot;-oxy-&quot; means an [[ether]] and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxymethane is the IUPAC name for [[dimethyl ether]].

It is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.

===Linear alkanes===
&lt;!-- redirected from [[linear paraffins]] --&gt;
Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix &quot;''n''-&quot; (for ''normal'') where a non-linear [[isomer]] exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g., [[hexane|''n''-hexane]] or 2- or 3-methylpentane. Alternative names for this group are: '''linear paraffins''' or '''''n''-paraffins'''.

The members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
:[[methane]], CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; – one carbon and four hydrogen
:[[ethane]], C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; – two carbon and six hydrogen
:[[propane]], C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; – three carbon and 8 hydrogen
:[[butane]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; – four carbon and 10 hydrogen
:[[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; – five carbon and 12 hydrogen
:[[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; – six carbon and 14 hydrogen

The first four names were [[back-formation|derived]] from [[methanol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[propionic acid]] and [[butyric acid]], respectively ([[hexadecane]] is also sometimes referred to as cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the [[Affix|suffix]] '''-ane''' to the appropriate [[IUPAC numerical multiplier|numerical multiplier]] prefix&lt;ref name = reusch-nom&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Nomenclature – Alkanes | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomen1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with elision of any terminal vowel (''-a'' or ''-o'') from the basic numerical term. Hence, [[pentane]], C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;; [[hexane]], C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;; [[heptane]], C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;; [[octane]], C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example [[nonane]], use the [[Latin language|Latin]] prefix '''non-'''. For a more complete list, see [[List of alkanes]].

===Branched alkanes===
[[Image:Isopentane-numbered-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of [[isopentane]] (common name) or 2-methylbutane (IUPAC systematic name)]]
Simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example [[pentane|''n''-pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]].

IUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.

The key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Examples of the IUPAC Rules in Practice | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomexmp1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms
* Name this longest root chain using standard naming rules
* Name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from &quot;-ane&quot; to &quot;-yl&quot;
* Number the root chain in order to give the lowest possible numbers for the side-chains{{clarify|date=December 2016}}{{cn|date=December 2016}}
* Number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain
* If there are multiple side chains of the same type, use prefixes such as &quot;di-&quot; and &quot;tri-&quot; to indicate it as such, and number each one.
* Add side chain names in alphabetical (disregarding &quot;di-&quot; etc. prefixes) order in front of the name of the root chain

===Saturated cyclic hydrocarbons===
{{Main article|Cycloalkane}}

Though technically distinct from the alkanes, this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the &quot;cyclic alkanes.&quot; As their description implies, they contain one or more rings.

Simple cycloalkanes have a prefix &quot;cyclo-&quot; to distinguish them from alkanes. Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones, e.g., [[cyclopentane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like [[pentane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, [[propane]] and [[cyclopropane]], [[butane]] and [[cyclobutane]], etc.

Substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes — the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by the [[Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules]].&lt;ref name=reusch-nom/&gt;

===Trivial/common names===
The trivial (non-[[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic]]) name for alkanes is ''paraffins''. Together, alkanes are known as the ''paraffin series''. Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.

It is almost certain that the term ''paraffin'' stems from the petrochemical industry. Branched-chain alkanes are called ''isoparaffins''. The use of the term &quot;paraffin&quot; is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of [[isomer]]s, i.e., compounds of the same [[chemical formula]], e.g., [[pentane]] and [[isopentane]].

;Examples
The following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system:
* [[isobutane]] for 2-methylpropane
* [[isopentane]] for 2-methylbutane
* [[neopentane]] for 2,2-dimethylpropane.

==Physical properties==

All alkanes are colourless and odourless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised+organic+chemistry.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192647/http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised%2Borganic%2Bchemistry.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;s-anand&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508081631/http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 May 2011 |title=13.

===Boiling point===
[[Image:AlkaneBoilingMeltingPoint.png|right|thumb|400px|Melting (blue) and boiling (orange) points of the first 16 ''n''-alkanes in °C.]]

Alkanes experience intermolecular [[van der Waals force]]s. Stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes.&lt;ref name=m&amp;b&gt;{{cite book|title = Organic Chemistry |author1=R. T. Morrison |author2=R. N. Boyd | isbn = 0-13-643669-2 | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = New Jersey | edition = 6th|year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces:
* the number of electrons surrounding the [[molecule]], which increases with the alkane's molecular weight
* the surface area of the molecule

Under [[standard conditions]], from CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; alkanes are gaseous; from C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt; they are liquids; and after C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt; they are solids. As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size ([[molecular weight]]) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30&amp;nbsp;°C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt;

A straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare [[isobutane]] (2-methylpropane) and [[n-butane]] (butane), which boil at −12 and 0&amp;nbsp;°C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58&amp;nbsp;°C, respectively.&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt; For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can &quot;lock&quot; into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.

On the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

===Melting points===
The [[melting point]]s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to [[boiling points]] for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-numbered alkanes pack less well and so the &quot;looser&quot; organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boese R, Weiss HC, Blaser D | title= The melting point alternation in the short-chain ''n''-alkanes: Single-crystal X-ray analyses of propane at 30&amp;nbsp;K and of ''n''-butane to ''n''-nonane at 90&amp;nbsp;K | journal= Angew Chem Int Ed | year=1999 | volume=38 | pages=988–992 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19990401)38:7&lt;988::AID-ANIE988&gt;3.3.CO;2-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for [[isoalkanes]] (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.

===Conductivity and solubility===
Alkanes do not conduct electricity, nor are they substantially [[Relative static permittivity|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason, they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] in that they repel water.

Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property that is called [[lipophilicity]]. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.

The density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane–water mixture.

===Molecular geometry===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Nylon]] --&gt;
[[Image:Ch4 hybridization.svg|thumb|right|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridization in [[methane]].]]
The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always [[Orbital hybridization|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized]], that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a [[tetrahedron]], the angle of cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(−{{sfrac|3}})&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;109.47° between them.

===Bond lengths and bond angles===
An alkane molecule has only C–H and C–C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of an sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals on different carbon atoms. The [[bond length]]s amount to 1.09&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C–H bond and 1.54&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m for a C–C bond.
[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of methane.]]

The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them. Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

===Conformation===
{{Main article|Alkane stereochemistry}}

The structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] for each carbon–carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformational isomerism|conformation]].
[[Image:Newman projection ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]
[[Image:Ethane-rotamers-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]]s of the two rotamers of ethane]]

[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: [[eclipsed]] conformation and [[staggered conformation]].

The two conformations, also known as [[rotamer]]s, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).

This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C–C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds.

The case of [[higher alkanes]] is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon–carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.

===Spectroscopic properties===
Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon–carbon, and carbon–hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a different functional group like [[Alcohol (chemistry)|–OH]], [[Aldehyde|–CHO]], [[Carboxylic acid|–COOH]] etc.

====Infrared spectroscopy====
The carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&amp;nbsp;[[Wavenumber|cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;]], while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1375&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1450&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

====NMR spectroscopy====
The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at [[chemical shift|''δ''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;]] = 0.5–1.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 8–30 (primary, methyl, –CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), 15–55 (secondary, methylene, –CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–), 20–60 (tertiary, methyne, C–H) and quaternary. The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] and the long [[relaxation time]], and can be missed in weak samples, or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time.

====Mass spectrometry====
Alkanes have a high [[ionization energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (''M''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;15) is often absent, and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups.

==Chemical properties==

Alkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances. The [[acid dissociation constant]] (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) values of all alkanes are above 60, hence they are practically inert to acids and bases (see: [[carbon acid]]s). This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' (with the meaning here of &quot;lacking affinity&quot;). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

However redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (−4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen (''if'' present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction [[stoichiometry]]) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Free radical halogenation]] reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of [[haloalkanes]]. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in [[carbon-hydrogen bond activation|C–H bond activation]].

[[Free radical]]s, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.

In highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5°) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hindrance]], and can substantially increase the reactivity.

===Reactions with oxygen (combustion reaction)===
All alkanes react with [[oxygen]] in a [[combustion]] reaction, although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:
:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + ({{sfrac|3|2}}''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:or C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + ({{sfrac|3''n'' + 1|2}})&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In the absence of sufficient oxygen, [[carbon monoxide]] or even [[soot]] can be formed, as shown below:

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&amp;nbsp;[[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''&amp;nbsp;[[carbon monoxide|CO]]

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2''n''+2&lt;/sub&gt; + ({{sfrac|2}}''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&amp;nbsp;[[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ''n''&amp;nbsp;[[carbon|C]]

For example, [[methane]]:
:2&amp;nbsp;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;CO + 4&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|3|2}}&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO + 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

See the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)#Alkanes|alkane heat of formation table]] for detailed data.
The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, for alkanes increases by about 650&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol per CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of Δ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;o&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.

=== Reactions with halogens ===
{{Main article|Free radical halogenation}}
Alkanes react with [[halogen]]s in a so-called ''free radical halogenation'' reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. [[Free radical]]s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], and can lead to an explosion.

These reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps:
* '''Initiation''' the halogen radicals form by [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required.
* '''Chain reaction''' or '''Propagation''' then takes place—the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical. This reacts further.
* '''Chain termination''' where the radicals recombine.

Experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane:&lt;ref name = m&amp;b/&gt;
[[Image:Monobromination of propane.png|500px|center|Monobromination of [[propane]]]]

=== Cracking ===
{{Main article|Cracking (chemistry)}}
Cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] mechanism with formation of [[free-radical]]s. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst]]s (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite]]s), which promote a [[heterolytic cleavage|heterolytic]] (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a [[carbocation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C–C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[intramolecular|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride]] transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding [[reactive intermediate]]s (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.

=== Isomerization and reformation ===
Dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;&gt;Asinger, Friedrich. Paraffins; Chemistry and Technology. Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a [[platinum]] catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers. In other words, it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens, keeping the same molecular weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;/&gt; In reformation, the alkanes become [[cycloalkane]]s or [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the [[octane number]] of the substance. Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization, as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asinger, Friedrich 1967&quot;/&gt;

===Other reactions===
Alkanes will react with [[steam]] in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]] to give [[hydrogen]]. Alkanes can be [[Chlorosulfonation|chlorosulfonated]] and [[nitration|nitrated]], although both reactions require special conditions. The [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of alkanes to [[carboxylic acid]]s is of some technical importance. In the [[Reed reaction]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorine]] and [[photochemistry|light]] convert hydrocarbons to [[Sulfonic acid|sulfonyl chlorides]]. [[Nucleophilic abstraction|Nucleophilic Abstraction]] can be used to separate an alkane from a metal. Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by [[transmetalation]] reactions.

==Occurrence==
{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}

===Occurrence of alkanes in the Universe===
[[Image:Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methane]] and [[ethane]] make up a tiny proportion&lt;!-- 0.3% methane and 0.00006% ethane is tiny not large --&gt; of [[Jupiter]]'s atmosphere]]

Uranus and Neptune have more but still small --&gt; of the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] of the outer gas planets such as [[Jupiter]] (0.1% methane, 2&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] ethane), [[Saturn]] (0.2% methane, 5&amp;nbsp;ppm ethane), [[Uranus]] (1.99% methane, 2.5&amp;nbsp;ppm ethane) and [[Neptune]] (1.5% methane, 1.5&amp;nbsp;ppm ethane). [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (1.6% methane), a satellite of Saturn, was examined by the [[Huygens (spacecraft)|''Huygens'' probe]], which indicated that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moon's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titan: Arizona in an Icebox? |url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2005/huygens_science-results_0121.html |author=Emily Lakdawalla |accessdate=21 January 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406104505/http://planetary.org/news/2005/0121_Titan_Arizona_in_an_Icebox.html |archivedate=6 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on Titan the Cassini mission has imaged seasonal methane/ethane lakes near the polar regions of Titan. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] have also been detected in the tail of the comet [[Hyakutake]]. Chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal, which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space, away from the Sun, which would have evaporated these volatile molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;science&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mumma, M.J. | title=Detection of Abundant Ethane and Methane, Along with Carbon Monoxide and Water, in Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake: Evidence for Interstellar Origin | journal=Science | year=1996 | volume=272 | doi=10.1126/science.272.5266.1310 | pmid=8650540 | last2 = Disanti |first2=M.A. |last3=dello Russo |first3=N. |last4=Fomenkova |first4=M. |last5=Magee-Sauer |first5=K. |last6=Kaminski |first6=C.D. |last7=D.X. |first7=Xie | issue=5266 | bibcode=1996Sci...272.1310M | pages=1310–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alkanes have also been detected in [[meteorite]]s such as [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s.

===Occurrence of alkanes on Earth===
Traces of methane gas (about 0.0002% or 1745&amp;nbsp;ppb) occur in the Earth's atmosphere, produced primarily by [[methanogenesis|methanogenic]] microorganisms, such as [[Archaea]] in the gut of ruminants.&lt;ref name=Janssen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janssen | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Kirs | first2 = M. | year = 2008 | title = Structure of the Archaeal Community of the Rumen | url = | journal = Appl Environ Microbiol | volume = 74 | issue = 12| pages = 3619–3625 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.02812-07 |pmc= 2446570 | pmid=18424540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and [[Petroleum|oil]].&lt;ref name=m&amp;b/&gt; Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some [[propane]] and [[butane]]: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other [[hydrocarbons]]. These hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → 3&amp;nbsp;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

These hydrocarbon deposits, collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks, comprise commercial [[oil fields]]. They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the [[energy crisis]].

Methane is also present in what is called [[biogas]], produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible [[renewable energy source]].

Alkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane clathrate]] (methane hydrate). Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together. Methane extracted from methane clathrate is, therefore, a candidate for future fuels.

===Biological occurrence===
Acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways.

;Bacteria and archaea
[[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in Earth's atmosphere.]]
Certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

On the other hand, certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantities of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidized]] organic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of [[hydrogen]]:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Methanogens are also the producers of [[marsh gas]] in [[wetlands]], and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}—the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of [[cattle]] and other [[herbivore]]s, which can release up to 150 liters per day,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and of [[termite]]s,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the [[intestine]]s of humans. Methanogenic archaea are, hence, at the end of the [[carbon cycle]], with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by [[photosynthesis]]. It is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

;Fungi and plants
Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups of organisms: [[Fungus|fungi]], plants and animals. Some specialized yeasts, e.g., ''Candida tropicale'', ''[[Pichia]]'' sp., ''[[Rhodotorula]]'' sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon or energy. The fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in [[aviation fuel]], and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.&lt;ref name=Hendey&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendey | first1 = N. I. | year = 1964 | title = Some observations on Cladosporium resinae as a fuel contaminant and its possible role in the corrosion of aluminium alloy fuel tanks | url = | journal = Transactions of the British Mycological Society | volume = 47 | issue = 7| pages = 467–475 | doi=10.1016/s0007-1536(64)80024-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants, the solid long-chain alkanes are found in the [[plant cuticle]] and [[epicuticular wax]] of many species, but are only rarely major constituents.&lt;ref name=Baker1982&gt;EA Baker (1982) Chemistry and morphology of plant epicuticular waxes. pp. 139-165. In &quot;The Plant Cuticle&quot;. edited by DF Cutler, KL Alvin and CE Price. Academic Press, London. {{ISBN|0-12-199920-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They protect the plant against water loss, prevent the [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of important minerals by the rain, and protect against bacteria, fungi, and harmful insects. The carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd-numbered, between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in length&lt;ref name=Baker1982/&gt; and are made by the plants by [[decarboxylation]] of even-numbered [[fatty acid]]s. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.&lt;ref name=Baker1982/&gt;

More volatile short-chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues. The [[Jeffrey pine]] is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of ''n''-[[heptane]] in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one [[octane rating]]. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and ''n''-[[nonane]] is a significant component in the scent of some [[rose]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 =HyunJung | last2=Kim | first2=NamSun | last3=Lee | first3=DongSun | year =  2000 | title = Determination of floral fragrances of Rosa hybrida using solid-phase trapping-solvent extraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. | url = | journal = Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 902 | issue = 2| pages =  389–404 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(00)00863-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as [[ethane]], [[pentane]], and [[hexane]] by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kesselmeier | first1 = J. | last2 = Staudt | first2 = N. | year = 1999 | title = Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC): An Overview on Emission, Physiology and Ecology | url = http://www.geo.uni-frankfurt.de/iau/epos/Gruppenintern/Kesselmeier___Staudt_JAC_1999.pdf | journal = Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry | volume = 33 | pages = 22–38 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6F5FQG2OP?url=http://www.geo.uni-frankfurt.de/iau/epos/Gruppenintern/Kesselmeier___Staudt_JAC_1999.pdf | archivedate = 13 March 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers, mainly 8 to 35, usually peaking in the low to upper 20s, with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram (parts per million by weight) and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreda

;Animals
Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% [[pristane]] (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;). They are important as [[pheromone]]s, chemical messenger materials, on which insects depend for communication. In some species, e.g. the support beetle ''[[Xylotrechus colonus]]'', [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;), 3-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;) are transferred by body contact. With others like the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'', the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;), and acts by smell over longer distances. [[waggle dance|Waggle-dancing]] [[honey bee]]s produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thom | date = 21 August 2007 | title = The Scent of the Waggle Dance | url = | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9| page = e228 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050228 | pmid=17713987 | pmc=1994260|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological relations===
[[Image:Ophrys sphegodes flower.jpg|thumb|right|Early spider orchid (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]'')]]
One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the [[sand bee]] (''[[Andrena nigroaenea]]'') and the [[early spider orchid]] (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]''); the latter is dependent for [[pollination]] on the former. Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;52&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[heptacosane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;56&lt;/sub&gt;) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result, numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.

==Production==

===Petroleum refining===
[[Image:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|thumb|right|An [[oil refinery]] at [[Martinez, California]].]]
As stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and [[crude oil]].&lt;ref name=m&amp;b/&gt; Alkanes are separated in an [[oil refinery]] by [[fractional distillation]] and processed into many different products.

===Fischer–Tropsch===
The [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen. This method is used to produce substitutes for [[petroleum distillate]]s.

===Laboratory preparation===
There is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo [[functional group interconversion]]s cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use of [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] as a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] gives the conjugate acid, ''n''-butane as a side-product:

: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Li + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; + [[lithium hydroxide|LiOH]]

However, at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an alkane-like functionality ([[alkyl]] group) using the above or similar methods. For example, an [[ethyl group]] is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] group, it gives [[ethanol]], which is not an alkane. To do so, the best-known methods are [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s:

:RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{spaces|5}}(R = [[alkyl]])

Alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from [[alkyl halide]]s in the [[Corey–House synthesis|Corey–House–Posner–Whitesides reaction]].

:[[Image:Clemmensen Reduction Scheme.png|250px|[[Clemmensen Reduction]]]]

==Applications==
The applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.

[[Propane]] and [[butane]] are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf Using propane as a fuel]&lt;/ref&gt; butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s.

From [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]], than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100, and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good [[solvent]]s for nonpolar substances.

Alkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterized by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.

Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In the latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example, in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.

Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].

Some synthetic [[polymer]]s such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.

Alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds.  This inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment. Due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226738847_Microbial_Degradation_of_Alkanes|title=Microbial Degradation of Alkanes (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are however some microorganisms possessing the metabolic capacity to utilize n-alkanes as both carbon and energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthe-Corti|first=L.|last2=Fetzner|first2=S.|date=2002-07-01|title=Bacterial Metabolism of n-Alkanes and Ammonia under Oxic, Suboxic and Anoxic Conditions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3846(200207)22:3/43.0.CO;2-F/abstract|journal=Acta Biotechnologica|language=en|volume=22|issue=3-4|pages=299–336|doi=10.1002/1521-3846(200207)22:3/43.0.CO;2-F|issn=1521-3846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bacterial species are highly specialised in degrading alkanes, these are referred to as hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria.

Methane is explosive when mixed with air (1–8% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable, although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain. Pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane are classed as ''dangerous for the environment'' and ''harmful''.

Considerations for detection or risk control:
* Methane is lighter than air (possibility of accumulation under roofs)
* Ethane is slightly heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground level or in pits)
* Propane is heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground level or in pits)
* Butane is heavier than air (possibility of pooling at ground level or in pits)

[[File:D.C. Court of Appeals.JPG|thumb|The [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
'''United States appellate procedure''' involves the rules and regulations for filing [[appeal]]s in [[state court (United States)|state courts]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the [[jurisdiction]] where the case was prosecuted. There are many types of [[standard of review]] for appeals, such as ''[[Trial de novo|de novo]]'' and [[abuse of discretion]]. However, most appeals begin when a party files a [[petition for review]] to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.

An [[appellate court]] is a [[court]] that hears cases on appeal from another court. Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a [[court case]] who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of law, [[fact]], procedure or due process. In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from state to state. The right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state; for example, the [[New Jersey Constitution]] vests judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with an appellate court being part of the Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to appellant status==
A party who files an appeal is called an &quot;appellant&quot;, &quot;plaintiff in error&quot;, &quot;petitioner&quot; or &quot;pursuer&quot;, and a party on the other side is called a &quot;appellee&quot;. A &quot;cross-appeal&quot; is an appeal brought by the respondent. For example, suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000. If the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money, then the plaintiff might file a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.

The appellant is the party who, having lost part or all their [[lawsuit|claim]] in a [[lower court]] decision, is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered. This is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law, but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct, or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence.

The appellant in the new case can be either the [[plaintiff]] (or claimant), [[defendant]], third-party [[intervenor]], or respondent (appellee) from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party. The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the respondent. In unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below, but still appeal.

An appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court [[judgment (law)|judgment]] was in its favor. The appellee is required to respond to the [[petition]], [[oral argument]]s, and [[legal brief]]s of the appellant. In general, the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court's decision should be affirmed.

==Ability to appeal==
An appeal &quot;as of right&quot; is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.  The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.  An appeal &quot;by leave&quot; or &quot;permission&quot; requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision. In the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], review in most cases is available only if the Court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/10.html|title=U.S. Supreme Court Rule 10|publisher=Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[tort]], [[equity (law)|equity]], or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.  In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal &quot;as of right&quot;.  And due to the [[double jeopardy]] principle, the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal.  But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal &quot;as of right&quot; from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion.  Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law &quot;by leave&quot; from the trial court or the appellate court.  The ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html |title=Consultation Paper on Prosecution Appeals Brought in Cases of Indictment |publisher=Law Reform Commission of Ireland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119043436/http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html |archivedate=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All parties must present grounds to appeal, or it will not be heard.

By convention in some law reports, the appellant is named first.  This can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals, the name of the case in the law reports reverses (in some cases twice) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy. This is not always true, however.  In the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], the parties' names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the [[United States Courts of Appeals|circuit courts of appeals]], and are re-ordered only if the appeal reaches the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Direct or collateral: Appealing criminal convictions==
Many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals, particularly in the criminal context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/postconv.htm|title=UK Law Online |publisher=University of Leeds }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03 |url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C154.txt |title=Special Habeas Corpus Procedures in Capital Cases |publisher=United States Office of the Law Revision Counsel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228011124/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C154.txt |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03 |url=http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc |title=State of Ohio |publisher=Ohio 12th District Court of Appeals |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227072142/http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc |archivedate=February 27, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the traditional &quot;direct&quot; appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review.  The second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case.

The key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts, and the latter in federal courts.{{dubious|Non-federal collateral review|date=May 2017}}

Relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in [[capital punishment|capital]] or violent [[felony]] cases.  The typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating [[DNA]] evidence demonstrating the defendant's actual innocence.

===Appellate review===
&quot;Appellate review&quot; is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate [[jurisdiction]] take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts. It is distinguished from [[Judicial review (theory)|judicial review]], which refers to the court's overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons (which may vary by jurisdiction).

In most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final [[Legal judgment|judgment]]. Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case.  This is because such orders cannot be appealed &quot;as of right&quot;. However, certain critical interlocutory [[court order]]s, such as the denial of a request for an interim [[injunction]], or an order holding a person in [[contempt of court]], can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of.

There are two distinct forms of appellate review, &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;collateral&quot;. For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on &quot;direct appeal&quot; to higher state appellate courts, and if unsuccessful, mount a &quot;collateral&quot; action such as filing for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] in the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. Generally speaking, &quot;[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact. ... [Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence, and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional, jurisdictional, or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial.&quot; &quot;Graham v. Borgen&quot;, 483 F 3d. 475 (7th Cir. 2007) (no. 04-4103) (slip op. at 7) (citation omitted).

In Anglo-American [[common law]] courts, appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by [[prerogative writ]] in certain cases.  There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems, though some mixed systems such as [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec]] recognize these prerogative writs.

====Direct Appeal====
After exhausting the first appeal as of right, defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision. This appeal is known as a direct appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bickford|first=James|title=Opinion Recap:All Judicial Review is either direct or collateral|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/03/opinion-summary-all-judicial-review-is-either-direct-or-collateral/|work=Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act|publisher=SCOTUS Bblog|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest state court, generally known as the Supreme Court, exercises discretion over whether it will review the case. On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process.

=====Preservation Issues=====
An appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at trial. This means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial. Because constitutional claims are of great magnitude, appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved. For example, Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; 2. the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; 3. the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; 4. if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dauman|first=Chad|title=Criminal Appeals in the United States: Preservation Issues|url=http://www.Chaddauman.blogspot.com|work=blog|accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State Post Conviction Relief: Collateral Appeal====
All States have a post-conviction relief process.  Similar to federal post-conviction relief, an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yackle|first=Larry|title=Federal Courts, Habeas Corpus|year=2003|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical claims might include [[ineffective assistance of counsel]] and actual innocence based on new evidence. These proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal, however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/rules/Documents/CHAPTER%207.%20APPELLATE%20RULES%20(entire%20chapter).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; After direct appeal, the conviction is considered final. An appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal. That is, it goes to the intermediate appellate court, followed by the highest court. If the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration, the sentence could be modified, or a new trial could be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process For Post-Conviction Relief|url=http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/pdf/pcvap_handout_post_conviction.pdf|work=Oregon Department of Justice|publisher=Oregon Department of Justice|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Habeas Corpus====
{{main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}

==Notice of appeal==
A &quot;notice of appeal&quot; is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal. The form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant's legal representative. The nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country.

The specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun. For example, the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court, or with the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.

Some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court's own web site.  In New Jersey, for example, the Administrative Office of the Court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants, though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short: traditionally, it is measured in days, not months. This can vary from country to country, as well as within a country, depending on the specific rules in force. In the U.S. federal court system, criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed, or the right to appeal is forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rule 4(b)(1)(A)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28a/usc_sec_28a_00000004----000-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appellate procedure==
{{See also|United States courts of appeals}}
Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not.  The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).

If the appellate court finds no defect, it &quot;affirms&quot; the judgment.  If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision &quot;below&quot; (i.e., in the lower court), it may &quot;modify&quot; the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify (&quot;reverse&quot; or &quot;vacate&quot;) the whole decision or any part of it.  It may, in addition, send the case back (&quot;remand&quot; or &quot;remit&quot;) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.

In some cases, an appellate court may review a lower court decision &quot;de novo&quot; (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact.  This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial [[motion to dismiss]] or motion for [[summary judgment]] which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.

Another situation is where appeal is by way of &quot;re-hearing&quot;. Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court.

Sometimes, the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below.  (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)

Generally, there is no [[Jury trial|trial]] in an appellate court, only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed—unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in &quot;very&quot; rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as [[prosecutorial misconduct]].

In some systems, an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.

The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it.  Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers, if represented, or &quot;[[pro se]]&quot; if the party has not engaged legal representation.  Those arguments are presented in written [[brief (law)|briefs]] and sometimes in [[oral argument]] to the court at a [[hearing (law)|hearing]]. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.

In an [[adversarial system]], appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore, if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner, or against [[Precedent|legal precedent]], that judgment will stand if not appealed – even if it might have been overturned on appeal.

The United States legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial &quot;de novo&quot; or an appeal on the record.

A [[trial de novo]] is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial [[trial (law)|trial]].  If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all.  If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial &quot;de novo&quot; by a [[court of record]].  In such a proceeding, all issues and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding.  Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In some cases, an application for &quot;trial de novo&quot; effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place.  The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that '&quot;This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to &quot;annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.&quot;'&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gaskill v. Commonwealth&quot;, 206 Va. 486, 490, 144 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  The only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses, where they are convicted on a lesser offense, the appeal is of the lesser offense; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses. &quot;[A] trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in [the] district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense,
permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser-included offense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kenyon v. Commonwealth&quot;, 37 Va. App. 668, 673, 561 S.E.2d 17, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal.  Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.  [[Precedent]] and [[case law]] figure prominently in the arguments.  In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed [[reversible error]], that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly.  Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously [[improper argument]] by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc.  The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not &quot;preserve the issue for appeal&quot; by objecting.

In cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness.  On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

In some cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered.  In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial.  Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.

A lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words &quot;May it please the court.&quot;

After an appeal is heard, the &quot;mandate&quot; is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and, when filed by the [[Court clerk|clerk]] of the trial court, constitutes the final judgment on the case, unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court. The mandate is distinguished from the appeal court's [[court opinion|opinion]], which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision. In some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the &quot;remittitur&quot;.

==Results==
The result of an appeal can be:
:*&lt;span id=&quot;Affirmed&quot;&gt;Affirmed&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court basically agrees with the result of the lower courts ruling(s). 
:*&lt;span id=&quot;Reversed&quot;&gt;Reversed&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court basically disagrees with the result of the lower courts ruling(s), and overturns their decision.
:*&lt;span id=&quot;Remanded&quot;&gt;Remanded&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court sends the case back to the lower court.

There can be multiple outcomes, so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings, reverse others and remand the case all at the same time. Remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case.  &quot;Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;State v. Randolph, 210 N.J. 330, 350 n.5 (2012), citing Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 28:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than ''review improvidently granted''. In other words, after looking at the case, they chose not to say anything.  The result for the case of ''review improvidently granted'' is effectively the same as affirmed, but without that extra higher court stamp of approval.

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

In law, an '''Answer''' was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or [[defense (legal)|defense]], a [[reply]] to a [[question]] or response, or [[objection (law)|objection]], or a correct solution of a problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Answer|volume=2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common law]], an '''Answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an ''optional'' &quot;pre-answer&quot; [[motion to dismiss]] or [[demurrer]]; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant ''must'' file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse [[default judgment]].

In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either [[guilt (law)|guilt]]y or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of [[equitable remedy]] such as [[restitution]] or a permanent [[injunction]]. Criminal cases may lead to [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s or other [[punishment]], such as [[imprisonment]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The famous Latin ''Responsa Prudentium'' (&quot;answers of the learned ones&quot;) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman [[lawyer]]s, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911&quot;/&gt;

During debates of a contentious nature, deflection, colloquially known as 'changing the topic', has been widely observed, and is often seen as a failure to answer a question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baaske|first1=Kevin|title=Arguments and Arguing: The Products and Process of Human Decision Making|date=2015|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''appellate court''', commonly called an '''''appeals court''''', '''''court of appeals''''' ([[American English]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/court%20of%20appeals |title=Court of appeals |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718133821/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/court%20of%20appeals |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''appeal court''''' ([[British English]]), '''''court of second instance''''' or '''''second instance court''''', is any [[court of law]] that is empowered to hear an [[appeal]] of a [[trial court]] or other lower [[tribunal]]. In most [[jurisdiction]]s, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a [[supreme court]] (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/supreme-court |title=Supreme Court |publisher=Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved October 26, 2012 from CollinsDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Illinois Civil Appellate Procedure |url=http://applawyers.org/Civil_Appeals_Guide_Revised.pdf |website=Appellate Lawyers Association |accessdate=7 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709111738/http://applawyers.org/Civil_Appeals_Guide_Revised.pdf |archivedate=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. In some areas the appellate court has limited powers of review. Generally, an appellate court's judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified.&lt;ref&gt;State v. Randolph, 210 N.J. 330, 350 n.5 (2012), citing Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books 2012), chapter 28:2&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
{{main|Court of Appeal of New Zealand}}

The [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand]], located in [[Wellington]], is New Zealand's principal intermediate appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court of Appeal|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/court-of-appeal|website=justice.govt.nz|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, most appeals are resolved at this intermediate appellate level, rather than in the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of the court system|url=http://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/about/system/history/overview/|website=courtsofnz.govt.nz|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sri Lanka==
{{main|Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka}}

The [[Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka]] is located in [[Colombo]], is the second most senior court in the [[Courts of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan legal system]].

==United States==
{{main|United States Supreme Court|United States courts of appeals}}
In the United States, both state and [[United States courts of appeals|federal]] appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations, rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Role and Structure|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/court-role-and-structure|website=United States Courts|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, U.S. appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court. Hence, such an appellate court will not consider an appellant's argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/law_related_education_network/how_courts_work/appeals.html|title=How Courts Work {{!}} Public Education|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most U.S. states, and in U.S. federal courts, parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right. This means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an [[appeal]] to contest that outcome. However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict. Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals. Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of [[discretionary review]], meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case.

===Institutional titles===
Many U.S. jurisdictions title their appellate court a '''''court of appeal''''' or '''''court of appeals'''''.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''court of appeals'' is not capitalized in carefully edited texts such as reference works, for example [http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Court+of+Appeal West's Encyclopedia of American Law] unless referring to a specific court or courts, but many legal professionals do not comply with this most common English usage shown in major dictionaries but rather capitalize this and many other legal texts.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, others have titled their appellate court a '''''court of errors''''' (or '''''court of errors and appeals'''''), on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts. Examples of such courts include the [[New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals]] (which existed from 1844 to 1947), the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors (which has been renamed the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]]), the Kentucky Court of Errors (renamed the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]]), and the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the [[Supreme Court of Mississippi]]). In some jurisdictions, courts able to hear appeals are known as an '''appellate division'''.

The phrase &quot;court of appeals&quot; most often refers to intermediate appellate courts.  However, the New York system is different: the &quot;[[New York Court of Appeals]]&quot; is the highest appellate court; and the phrase &quot;[[New York Supreme Court]]&quot; applies to the trial court of general jurisdiction.

Depending on the system, certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts, hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts, such as the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]], which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]], which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases, on one hand, and appeals from the [[Court of Federal Claims]] on the other.

'''Arraignment''' is a formal reading of a [[crime|criminal]] charging document in the presence of the [[defendant]] to inform the defendant of the charges against him or her. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdiction but they generally include &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;not guilty&quot;, and the [[peremptory pleas]] (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. Pleas of &quot;[[nolo contendere]]&quot; (no contest) and the &quot;[[Alford plea|''Alford'' plea]]&quot; are allowed in some circumstances.

== Australia ==

In Australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]]. The judge will testify during the indictment process.

== Canada ==

In every province in Canada except British Columbia, defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial.  In British Columbia, arraignment takes places in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer. The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge.

== France ==

In France, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest.&lt;ref name=fti-france&gt;{{cite web|title=CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND DEFENCE RIGHTS IN FRANCE|publisher=[[Fair Trials International]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/France-advice-note.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime.&lt;ref name=fti-france/&gt; The police needs to have the consent of the prosecutor (in the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent).&lt;ref name=fti-france/&gt;

== Germany ==

In Germany, if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest.&lt;ref name=fti-germany&gt;{{cite web|title=CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND DEFENCE RIGHTS IN GERMANY|publisher=[[Fair Trials International]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/Germany-advice-note.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Zealand ==

At the first appearance, the accused is read the charges and asked for a plea. The available pleas are, guilty, not guilty, and no plea.  No plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea, which must be made on the second appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howtolaw.co/facing-criminal-charges-392160&lt;/ref&gt;

== South Africa ==

In South Africa, arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear, the informing of the accused of the crime charged against him, the demanding of the accused whether he be guilty or not guilty, and the entering of his plea. His plea having been entered he is said to stand arraigned.

== United Kingdom ==

In England, Wales, and [[Northern Ireland]], arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]].

In England and Wales, the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than 24 hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent (or above) authorises detention for a further 12 hours (36 hours total), or a judge (who will be a magistrate) authorises detention by the police before charge for up to a maximum of 96 hours, but for terrorism-related offences people can be held by the police for up to 28 days before charge.&lt;ref name=fti-england-wales&gt;{{cite web|title=CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND DEFENCE RIGHTS IN ENGLAND AND WALES|publisher=[[Fair Trials International]]|url=http://www.fairtrials.org/wp-content/uploads/Criminal-Proceedings-and-Defence-Rights-in-England-and-Wales-Aug-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they are not released after being charged, they should be brought before a court as soon as practicable.&lt;ref name=fti-england-wales/&gt;

== United States ==

Under the United States [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]], &quot;arraignment shall [consist of an] open...reading [of] the [[indictment]]...to the defendant...and call[] on him to plead thereto. He/she shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he/she is called upon to plead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{frcrp|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In federal courts, arraignment takes place in two stages. The first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Criminal Procedure |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |year=2012 |edition=8th |first=Joel |last=Samaha |isbn=978-0-495-91335-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. The presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set [[bail]]. During the second arraignment, a post-indictment arraignment or PIA, the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.

In New York, most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruling Forces New York to Release Or Arraign Suspects in 24 Hours|first=Kevin|last=Sack|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 March 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/27/nyregion/ruling-forces-new-york-to-release-or-arraign-suspects-in-24-hours.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and, in any event, within 48 hours of arrest, excluding weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name=riverside&gt;[[County of Riverside v. McLaughlin]], 500 U.S. 44 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=California Basic Practice Handbook|date=November 2016|publisher=Regents of the University of California|isbn=9780762624676|page=6-11|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, an individual arrested without a warrant, in some cases, may be held for as long as 168 hours (7 days) without arraignment or charge.&lt;ref name=riverside/&gt;

==Form of the arraignment==
The wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;In some jurisdictions the wording of the arraignment is set by statute or court practice direction.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it generally conforms with the following principles:
# The accused person ([[defendant]]) is addressed by [[name]];
# The [[criminal charge|charge]] against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time, and place of offense (and sometimes the names of the state's witnesses and the range of punishment for the charge(s)); and,
# The accused person is asked formally how he or she [[plea]]ds.

==Video arraignment==
'''Video arraignment''' is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of [[videoconferencing]] technology. Use of video arraignment system allows the [[court]]s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the [[courtroom]] by using an [[audio-visual]] link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.

Use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. The transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.

==Guilty and not-guilty pleas==
If the defendant pleads guilty, an [[Preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character, and passes [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

If the defendant pleads [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]], a date is set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or a [[trial]].

In the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or &quot;stood mute&quot;) was subject to [[peine forte et dure]] ([[Law French]] for &quot;strong and hard punishment&quot;). Today in [[Common law|common-law]] jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea.&lt;ref&gt;In Queensland, Australia, this matter is covered by statute. See s601 of the Queensland [[Criminal Code]].&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for this is the defendant's [[right to silence]].

==Pre-trial release==
This is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.

The lyrics were written by [[Katharine Lee Bates]], and the music was composed by church organist and choirmaster [[Samuel A. Ward]] at [[Grace Church (Newark)|Grace Episcopal Church]] in Newark, New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/03/america_the_beautiful_began_in_newark_di_ionno.html#incart_river_index|title='America the Beautiful' began in Newark {{!}} Di Ionno|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bates originally wrote the words as a poem, &quot;Pikes Peak&quot;, first published in the [[Fourth of July]] edition of the church periodical ''The Congregationalist'' in 1895. At that time, the poem was titled &quot;America&quot; for publication.

Ward had originally written the music, &quot;Materna&quot;, for the hymn &quot;[[O Mother dear, Jerusalem]]&quot; in 1882, though it was not first published until 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKim|first=LindaJo|title=The Presbyterian Hymnal Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kde8yd0INHsC&amp;pg=PA379|page=379|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Kentucky|accessdate=2012-06-22|year=1993|isbn=9780664251802}} (McKim notes that Ward mailed a friend a postcard in which he stated the hymn had been composed in 1882, however).&lt;/ref&gt; Ward's music combined with the Bates poem was first published in 1910 and titled ''America the Beautiful''.

The song is one of the most popular of the many American patriotic songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.100010615/full.html |title=Materna (O Mother Dear, Jerusalem) / Samuel Augustus Ward [hymnal&amp;#93;:Print Material Full Description: Performing Arts Encyclopedia, Library of Congress |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Americathebeautiful.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Commemoration plaque atop [[Pikes Peak]] in July 1999]]

In 1893, at the age of 33, Bates, an English professor at [[Wellesley College]], had taken a train trip to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], Colorado, to teach a short summer school session at [[Colorado College]]. Several of the sights on her trip inspired her, and they found their way into her poem, including the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], the &quot;White City&quot; with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings; the wheat fields of America's heartland [[Kansas]], through which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the [[Great Plains]] from high atop [[Pikes Peak]].

On the pinnacle of that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original [[Antlers Hilton Hotel|Antlers Hotel]]. The poem was initially published two years later in ''The Congregationalist'' to commemorate [[the Fourth of July.]] It quickly caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1911.

Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem. A [[hymn tune]] composed by [[Samuel A. Ward]] was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired to compose his tune. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from [[Coney Island]] back to his home in [[New York City]], after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately wrote it down. Supposedly, he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on. He composed the tune for the old hymn &quot;O Mother Dear, Jerusalem&quot;, retitling the work &quot;Materna&quot;. Ward's music combined with Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and titled &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain since the music was only first applied to the song in 1904. Bates was more fortunate since the song's popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929.

At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written, particularly during the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration, there have been efforts to give &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;, but so far this has not succeeded.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Proponents prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;. Some prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; over &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; due to the latter's war-oriented imagery. Others prefer &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; for the same reason. While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

This song was used as the background music of the television broadcast of the [[Tiangong-1]] launch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/30/china-launch-america-the-beautiful&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of religious congregations in the United States.

==Popular versions==
In 1976, while the United States celebrated its bicentennial, a soulful version popularized by [[Ray Charles]] peaked at number 98 on the US R&amp;B Charts,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Charles discography]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is included on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[The Sandlot]]''.

Three different renditions of the song have entered the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. The first was by [[Charlie Rich]], which went to number 22 in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=350|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second, by [[Mickey Newbury]], peaked at number 82 in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; An [[all-star]] version of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; performed by [[country music|country]] singers [[Trace Adkins]], [[Sherrié Austin]], [[Billy Dean]], [[Vince Gill]], [[Carolyn Dawn Johnson]], [[Toby Keith]], [[Brenda Lee]], [[Lonestar]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Lila McCann]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Jamie O'Neal]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Collin Raye]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Phil Vassar]] reached number 58 in July 2001. The song re-entered the chart following the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitburn, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[punk rock]] adaptation of the song was recorded in 1976 by [[New York City|New York]] band [[The Dictators]], and released on their album Every Day is Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.discogs.com/Dictators-Every-Day-Is-Saturday/release/2656919 Dictators discography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Popularity of the song increased greatly following the September 11 attacks; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem. During the first taping of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' following the attacks, CBS newsman [[Dan Rather]] cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2001-09-18 |work=Salon.com |title=Dan Rather's tears; Journalists don't cry on camera.

For [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]] aired a multilingual version of the song, sung in several different languages.  The commercial received some criticism on social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, and from some conservatives, such as [[Glenn Beck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/coca-cola-super-bowl-ad-angers-conservatives-article-1.1600849|title=Coca Cola's Super Bowl ad angers conservatives|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/02/03/coca-cola-ad-super-bowl-racism/5177463/|title=Coca-Cola Super Bowl ad: Can you believe this reaction?|website=USA TODAY|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3773/coca-colas-its-beautiful-super-bowl-ad-brings-out-some-ugly-americans/ | work=Time | first=James | last=Poniewozik | title=Coca-Cola's &quot;It's Beautiful&quot; Super Bowl Ad Brings Out Some Ugly Americans | date=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the controversies, Coca-Cola later reused the Super Bowl ad during [[Super Bowl LI]], the opening ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Olympics]] and in patriotic holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coca-colacompany.com/press-center/company-statements/its-beautiful-commercial &quot;It's Beautiful&quot; Commercial] by the Coca-Cola Company Press Center.

==Idioms==
&quot;From sea to shining sea&quot;, originally used in the charters of some of the English Colonies in North America, is an American [[idiom]] meaning &quot;from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]&quot; (or vice versa). Other songs that have used this phrase include the American patriotic song &quot;[[God Bless the USA]]&quot; and [[Schoolhouse Rock]]'s &quot;Elbow Room&quot;. The phrase and the song are also the namesake of the [[Shining Sea Bikeway]], a [[bike path]] in Bates's hometown of [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]]. The phrase is similar to the Latin phrase &quot;''{{Lang|la|[[A Mari Usque Ad Mare]]}}''&quot; (&quot;From sea to sea&quot;), which serves as the official motto of [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Gary|title=From sea to shining sea|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/from%20sea%20to%20shining%20sea.html|website=Phrases.org|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Purple mountain majesties&quot; refers to the shade of the [[Pikes Peak]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], which inspired Bates to write the poem.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanheritage.org/Elementary_Extraction_15-America_the_Beautiful_TX.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904222648/http://www.americanheritage.org/Elementary_Extraction_15-America_the_Beautiful_TX.pdf |date=September 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
[[Lynn Sherr]]'s 2001 book ''America the Beautiful'' discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth. The book points out that the poem has the same meter as that of &quot;[[Auld Lang Syne]]&quot;; the songs can be sung interchangeably. Additionally, Sherr discusses the evolution of the lyrics, for instance, changes to the original third verse written by Bates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=America the Beautiful: The Stirring True Story Behind Our Nation's Favorite Song |first=Lynn |last=Sherr |publisher=PublicAffairs |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-58648-085-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HdSmeAv3v-oC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |page=78 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song appears in [[Ellen Raskin]]'s ''[[The Westing Game]]''.

'''Assistive technology''' is an [[umbrella term]] that includes assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for [[disability|people with disabilities]] and also includes the process used in selecting, locating, and using them. Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks.

==Adaptive technology==
The term adaptive technology is often used as the [[synonym]] for assistive technology; however, they are different terms. Assistive technology refers to &quot;any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://section508.gov/assistive-technology-act-1998|title=Assistive Technology Act of 1998 {{!}} Section508.gov|website=section508.gov|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non-disabled persons. In other words, &quot;assistive technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities,&quot; while adaptive technology is &quot;any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tennessee Science Standards | url = http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078901359/594902/AAT_v4.pdf | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology. Adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Assessing for Adaptive Technology Needs | url = http://dtn.tamu.edu/pdf/pp-assessingAT.ppt | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility impairments==

=== Wheelchairs ===
{{Main|Wheelchair}}
Wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related [[activities of daily living]] which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices comes in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a [[joystick]], [[sip-and-puff]] control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom [[walking]] is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.

=== Transfer devices ===
{{Main|Patient lift}}
Patient transfer devices generally allow patients with impaired mobility to be moved by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, commodes, toilets, chairs, stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are [[Patient lift]]s (for vertical transfer), [[Transfer bench]]es, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer from a gurney to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a [[Patient lift]] (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art transfer device by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.

=== Walkers ===
{{Main|Walker (mobility)|l1=Walker}}A [[walker (mobility)|walker]] or walking frame or Rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking. It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or for heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.&lt;ref&gt;C. Barrué. Personalization and Shared Autonomy in Assistive Technologies. Ph. Thesis. Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prosthesis ===
{{Main|Prosthesis}}A '''prosthesis''', '''prosthetic''', or '''prosthetic limb'''  is a device that replaces a missing [[Human body|body]] part. It is part of the field of [[biomechatronics]], the science of using [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] devices with human [[muscle]], [[skeleton]], and [[nervous systems]] to assist or enhance motor control lost by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[disease]], or [[Congenital disorder|defect]]. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth ([[congenital]]) or to supplement defective body parts. Inside the body, [[artificial heart valve]]s are in common use with [[artificial heart]]s and [[artificial lung|lungs]] seeing less common use but under active technology development. Other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include [[hearing aids]], [[visual prosthesis|artificial eyes]], [[palatal obturator]], [[Adjustable gastric band|gastric bands]], and [[dentures]].

Prostheses are specifically ''not'' [[orthoses]], although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis.  Prostheses are technically the complete finished item.  For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is ''not'' a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic ''component''. The complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system&amp;nbsp; to the residual limb — usually a &quot;socket&quot;, and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device. Keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged.

The terms &quot;prosthetic&quot; and &quot;orthotic&quot; are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee.  The terms &quot;prosthetics&quot; and &quot;orthotics&quot; are used to describe the respective allied health fields.  The devices themselves are properly referred to as &quot;prostheses&quot; and &quot;orthoses&quot; in the plural and &quot;prosthesis&quot; and &quot;orthosis&quot; in the singular.

== Visual impairments ==
{{Main|Blindness#Management}}
Many people with serious visual impairments live independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques.  Examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include screen readers, screen magnifiers, Braille embossers, desktop video magnifiers, and voice recorders.

=== Screen readers ===
{{Main|Screen reader}}

Screen readers allow the visually impaired to easily access electronic information. These software programs connect to a computer to read the text displayed out loud. There are a variety of platforms and applications available for a variety of costs.[[File:English braille sample.jpg|thumb|Braille is a system of raised dots representing letters, numbers, punctuation, and words.]]

=== Braille and braille embossers ===
{{Main|Braille}}
Braille is a system of raised dots formed into units called braille cells. A full braille cell is made up of six dots, with two parallel rows of three dots, but other combinations and quantities of dots represent other letters, numbers, punctuation marks, or words. People can then use their fingers to read the code of raised dots.

A braille embosser is, simply put, a printer for braille. Instead of a standard printer adding ink onto a page, the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page. Some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch.

=== Desktop video magnifier ===
{{Main|Video magnifier}}
Desktop video magnifiers are electronic devices that use a camera and a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials. They enlarge printed pages for those with low vision. A camera connects to a monitor that displays real time images, and the user can control settings such as magnification, focus, contrast, underlining, highlighting, and other screen preferences. They come in a variety of sizes and styles; some are small and portable with handheld cameras, while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand.

=== Screen magnification software ===
{{Main|Screen magnifier}}
A screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computer's graphical output to present enlarged screen content. It allows users to enlarge the texts and graphics on their computer screens for easier viewing. Similar to desktop video magnifiers, this technology assists people with low vision. After the user loads the software into their computer's memory, it serves as a kind of &quot;computer magnifying glass.&quot; Wherever the computer cursor moves, it enlarges the area around it. This allows greater computer accessibility for a wide range of visual abilities.

[[File:MAGic Large Print Keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;This large-print keyboard has tactile elements and special keys for the visually impaired&lt;/center&gt;|alt=MAGic Large Print This MAGic large-print keyboard has tactile elements and special keys for the visually impaired]]

=== Large-print and tactile keyboards ===
A large-print keyboard has large letters printed on the keys.  On the keyboard shown, the round buttons at the top control software which can magnify the screen (zoom in), change the background color of the screen, or make the mouse cursor on the screen larger.  The &quot;bump dots&quot; on the keys, installed in this case by the organization using the keyboards, help the user find the right keys in a tactile way.

=== Navigation Assistance ===
[[GPS_for_the_visually_impaired|Assistive technology for navigation]] has exploded on the [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp IEEE Xplore database] since 2000, with over 7,500 engineering articles written on assistive technologies and visual impairment in the past 25 years, and over 1,300 articles on solving the problem of navigation for people who are blind or visually impaired. As well, over 600 articles on augmented reality and visual impairment have appeared in the engineering literature since 2000. Most of these articles were published within the past 5 years, and the number of articles in this area is increasing every year. GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and cameras can pinpoint the exact location of the user and provide information on what’s in the immediate vicinity, and assistance in getting to a destination.

Some navigation assistants (for both indoors and outdoors) include:

==Personal emergency response systems==
{{Main|Telecare}}
[[File:Head-wand.jpg|thumb|This voter with a [[manual dexterity]] disability is making choices on a [[touchscreen]] with a head dauber]]
[[Personal emergency response systems]] (PERS), or [[Telecare]] (UK term), are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer. An example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for [[hypothermia]] risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild [[dementia]]). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.

==Accessibility software==
{{Main|Computer accessibility}}
In human–computer interaction, computer accessibility (also known as accessible computing) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include [[web accessibility]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/page.cfm?pagecode=ISSIWD Web accessibility guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&amp;title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface]&lt;/ref&gt; This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by [[SNAPI]] and has been successfully incorporated into the [[Lasseo]] specifications, but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.

==Hearing impairments==
{{Main|Assistive Technology for Deaf and Hard of Hearing}}
The deaf or hard of hearing community has a difficult time to communicate and perceive information as compared to hearing individuals. Thus, these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information. The use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to their problems by providing higher sound (for those who are hard of hearing), tactile feedback, visual cues and improved technology access. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing utilize a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with improved accessibility to information in numerous environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Assistive Technology for Individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing | url = http://www.wati.org/content/supports/free/pdf/Ch13-Hearing.pdf | accessdate = 2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and/or vibration. These technologies can be grouped into three general categories: [[Assistive Technology for Deaf and Hard of Hearing#Hearing Technology|Hearing Technology]], alerting devices, and [[Assistive Technology for Deaf and Hard of Hearing#Communication Support|communication support]].

=== Hearing aids ===
{{Main|Hearing aid}}
A hearing aid or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. This type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing them to hear more clearly. They amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.

=== Assistive listening devices ===
{{Main|Assistive listening device}}
Assistive listening devices include FM, infrared, and loop assistive listening devices. This type of technology allows people with hearing difficulties to focus on a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions, making places like auditoriums, classrooms, and meetings much easier to participate in. The assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmission, IR (Infra Red) transmission, IL (Induction Loop) transmission, or other transmission method. The person who is listening may use an FM/IR/IL Receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his/her preferred volume.

=== Amplified telephone equipment ===
{{Main|Telecommunications device for the deaf|l1=Telecommunications device for the deaf#Other devices for the deaf or hard of hearing}}
This type of assistive technology allows users to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls so that they can easily partake in this medium of communication. There are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs. Additionally, there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from, with different degrees of amplification. For example, a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss, while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel is better for more severe hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guide to Amplified Phones|url = https://assistech.com/store/amplified-telephone-guide|website = assistech.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Augmentative and alternative communication==
{{Main|Augmentative and alternative communication}}
[[File:AAC user using eye gaze.JPG|thumb|An AAC user uses number coding on an eye gaze communication board]]
'''Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)''' is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language.&lt;ref name=asha2005&gt;[[#refASHA2005|ASHA (2005)]].&lt;/ref&gt; AAC systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user. They may be as basic as pictures on a board that are used to request food, drink, or other care; or they can be advanced [[speech generating device]]s, based on speech synthesis, that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words.&lt;ref name=&quot;GillamMarquardt2000&quot;&gt;[[#refGillamMarqardt2000|Gilliam &amp; Marquardt]], pp. 356–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive impairments==
{{Main|Cognitive orthotics}}

Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 14, 5-39.&lt;/ref&gt; is the use of technology (usually high tech) to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention, memory, self-regulation, navigation, [[emotion recognition]] and management, planning, and sequencing activity. Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC are growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, A., Best, C. &amp; O'Neill, B. (2012).

Accessed 2009-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory aids ===
Memory aids are any type of assistive technology that helps a user learn and remember certain information. Many memory aids are used for cognitive impairments such as reading, writing, or organizational difficulties. For example, a Smartpen records handwritten notes by creating both a digital copy and an audio recording of the text. Users simply tap certain parts of their notes and the pen saves it and reads it back to them. From there, the user can also download their notes onto a computer for increased accessibility. Digital voice recorders are also used to record &quot;in the moment&quot; information for fast and easy recall at a later time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using External Aids to Compensate for Memory and Organizational Problems Post-TBI|url = http://www.brainline.org/content/2011/04/using-external-aids-to-compensate-for-memory-and-organizational-problems-post-tbi.html|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational software ===
{{Main|Educational software}}

Educational software is software that assists people with reading, learning, comprehension, and organizational difficulties. Any accommodation software such as text readers, notetakers, text enlargers, organization tools, word predictions, and talking word processors falls under the category of educational software.

==Assistive technology in sport==
[[File:NYC Marathon wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A [[New York City Marathon]] competitor uses a racing wheelchair]]
Assistive technology in sport is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive technology may be used in [[adaptive sports]], where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.

An increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new assistive technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scherer, Marcia  |author2=Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology devices can be simple, or &quot;low-tech&quot;, or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers. Assistive technology for sports may also be simple, or advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assistive technologies|url=http://www.understandingdisability.org/AssistiveTechnologies|publisher=Spaulding Framingham|accessdate=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to the elite [[Paralympic Games]]. More complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities &quot;have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Scherer, Marcia  |author2=Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistive technology in education==
In the United States there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system. The first is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the second being the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which was first enacted in 1975 under the name The Education for All Handicapped Children Act.  In 2004, during the reauthorization period for IDEA, the National Instructional Material Access Center (NIMAC) was created which provided a repository of accessible text including publisher's textbooks to students with a qualifying disability.  Files provided are in XML format and used as a starting platform for braille readers, screen readers, and other digital text software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimac.us/ |title=National Instructional Materials Access Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;  IDEA defines assistive technology as follows: &quot;any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of a child with a disability. (B) Exception.--The term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted, or the replacement of such device.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/,root,statute,I,A,602,1, |title=Building the Legacy: IDEA 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assistive technology in this area is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for  writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.

==Computer accessibility==
{{Main|Computer accessibility}}
[[File:Sip-and-puff device.jpg|thumb|A [[sip-and-puff]] device which allows a person with substantial disability to make selections and navigate computerized interfaces by controlling inhalations and exhalations]]
One of the largest problems that affect people with disabilities is discomfort with prostheses.&lt;ref name=hussein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abdullah|first=Hussein A.|author2=Tarry, Cole|author3=Datta, Rahul.|author4=Mittal, Gauri S.|author5=Abderrahim, Mohamed|title=Dynamic Biomechanical Model for Assessing and Monitoring Robot-Assisted Upper-Limb Therapy|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development|year=2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=43–62|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2006.03.0025|pmid=17551857}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experiment performed in Massachusetts utilized 20 people with various sensors attached to their arms.&lt;ref name=hussein /&gt; The subjects tried different arm exercises, and the sensors recorded their movements. All of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts for prosthetics.&lt;ref name=hussein /&gt;

Assistive technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as [[Dvorak Simplified Keyboard|Dvorak]] and other alternative keyboard layouts, which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chubon, R.A. |author2=Hester, M.R. |title=An enhanced standard computer keyboard system for single-finger and typing-stick typing |journal=[[Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development]] |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=17–24 |year=1988 |pmid=2973523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anson, D. |author2=George, S. |author3=Galup, R. |author4=Shea, B. |author5=Vetter, R. |title=Efficiency of the Chubon versus the QWERTY keyboard |journal=

Assistive technology devices have been created to enable people with disabilities to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as the [[iPad]], [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]]. The Pererro is a plug and play adapter for [[iOS]] devices which uses the built in [[Apple VoiceOver]] feature in combination with a basic switch. This brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it. Apple, with the release of iOS 7 had introduced the ability to navigate apps using switch control. Switch access could be activated either through an external bluetooth connected switch, single touch of the screen, or use of right and left head turns using the device's camera. Additional accessibility features include the use of Assistive Touch which allows a user to access multi-touch gestures through pre-programmed onscreen buttons.

For users with physical disabilities a large variety of switches are available and customizable to the user's needs varying in size, shape, or amount of pressure required for activation. [[Switch access]] may be placed near any area of the body which has consistent and reliable mobility and less subject to fatigue. Common sites include the hands, head, and feet. Eye gaze and head mouse systems can also be used as an alternative mouse navigation. A user may utilize single or multiple switch sites and the process often involves a  scanning through items on a screen and activating the switch once the desired object is highlighted.

==Home automation==
The form of [[home automation]] called [[assistive domotics]] focuses on making it possible for elderly and disabled people to live independently. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users. For example, automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre-recorded audio messages; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven, and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Assistive technology - devices to help with everyday living|url = https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=109|website = www.alzheimers.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en|first = Natasha|last = Judd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impacts of assistive technology ==
Overall, assistive technology aims to allow people with disabilities to &quot;participate more fully in all aspects of life (home, school, and community)&quot; and increases their opportunities for &quot;education, social interactions, and potential for meaningful employment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Considering Assistive Technology {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|url = http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/considering-at/|website = www.parentcenterhub.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals. For example, in one study of 1,342 infants, toddlers and preschoolers, all with some kind of developmental, physical, sensory, or cognitive disability, the use of assistive technology created improvements in child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desch|first=Larry W.|last2=Gaebler-Spira|first2=Deborah|date=2008-06-01|title=Prescribing Assistive-Technology Systems: Focus on Children With Impaired Communication|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/121/6/1271|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1271–1280|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0695|issn=0031-4005|pmid=18519500}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included improvements in &quot;cognitive, social, communication, literacy, motor, adaptive, and increases in engagement in learning activities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://community.fpg.unc.edu/sites/community.fpg.unc.edu/files/resources/Handout/CONNECT-Handout-5-1.pdf|title = Research Summary on Assistive Technology Interventions|date = August 2013|accessdate = 24 November 2015|website = Community|publisher = |author1=Dunst, Trivette |author2=Hamby, Simkus }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been found to lighten caregiver load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicolson|first1=Amy|last2=Moir|first2=Lois|last3=Millsteed|first3=Jeannine|title=Impact of assistive technology on family caregivers of children with physical disabilities: a systematic review|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology|date=22 March 2012|volume=7|issue=5|pages=345–349|doi=10.3109/17483107.2012.667194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woodcut shows ''Arithmetica'' instructing an [[algorism|algorist]] and an abacist (inaccurately represented as [[Boethius]] and [[Pythagoras]]). There was keen competition between the two from the introduction of the ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Algebra]]'' into Europe in the 12th century until its triumph in the 16th.&lt;ref name=Boyer253&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''abacus''' (''plural'' '''abaci''' or '''abacuses'''), also called a '''counting frame''', is a calculating tool that was in use in Europe, China and Russia, centuries before the adoption of the written [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref name=Boyer253/&gt; The exact origin of the abacus is still unknown. Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.

Abaci come in different designs. Some designs, like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach arithmetic, although they remain popular in the [[post-Soviet states]] as a tool. Other designs, such as the Japanese [[soroban]], have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits. For any particular abacus design, there usually are numerous different methods to perform a certain type of calculation, which may include basic operations like addition and multiplication, or even more complex ones, such as calculating [[Square root|square roots]]. Some of these methods may work with non-[[Natural number|natural]] numbers (numbers such as {{Math|1.5}} and {{Math|{{Frac|3|4}}}}).

Although today many use [[Calculator|calculators]] and [[Computer|computers]] instead of abaci to calculate, abaci still remain in common use in some countries. Merchants, traders and clerks in some parts of [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[Africa]] use abaci, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer253&quot; /&gt; Some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus.

==Etymology==
The use of the word ''abacus'' dates before 1387 AD, when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus. The Latin word came from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄβαξ ''abax'' which means something without base, and improperly, any piece of rectangular board or plank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Stefani|1909|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaisford|1962|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lasserre|Livadaras|1976|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Alternatively, without reference to ancient texts on etymology, it has been suggested that it means &quot;a square tablet strewn with dust&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1966|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;drawing-board covered with dust (for the use of mathematics)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onions|Friedrichsen|Burchfield|1967|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of the Greek word, ἄβακoς ''abakos''). Whereas the table strewn with dust definition is popular, there are those that do not place credence in this at all and in fact state that it is not proven.&lt;ref name=pull17&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Both C. J. Gadd, a keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the [[British Museum]], and [[Jacob Levy]], a Jewish Historian who wrote ''Neuhebräisches und chaldäisches wörterbuch über die Talmudim und Midraschim [Neuhebräisches and Chaldean dictionary on the Talmuds and Midrashi]'' disagree with the &quot;dust table&quot; theory.&lt;ref name=pull17/&gt;}} Greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a [[Northwest Semitic]], perhaps [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], word akin to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ʾābāq'' (אבק), &quot;dust&quot; (or in post-Biblical sense meaning &quot;sand used as a writing surface&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Huehnergard|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preferred plural of ''abacus'' is a subject of disagreement, with both ''abacuses''&lt;ref name = SOED&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''abaci''&lt;ref name = SOED/&gt; in use. The user of an abacus is called an ''abacist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gove|1976|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mesopotamian===
The period 2700–2300 BC saw the first appearance of the [[Sumer]]ian abacus, a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their [[sexagesimal]] number system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars point to a character from the [[Babylon]]ian [[cuneiform]] which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crump|1992|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the belief of Old Babylonian&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Melville|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholars such as Carruccio that Old Babylonians &quot;may have used the abacus for the operations of [[addition]] and [[subtraction]]; however, this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carruccio|2006|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian===
The use of the abacus in [[Ancient Egypt]] is mentioned by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who writes that the Egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left, opposite in direction to the Greek left-to-right method. Archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters. However, wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered.&lt;ref name=Smith1&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1958|pp=157–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persian===
During the [[Achaemenid Empire]], around 600 BC the Persians first began to use the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carr|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Sassanian]] and [[Iran]]ian empires, scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them – [[India]], [[China]], and the [[Roman Empire]], when it is thought to have been exported to other countries.

=== Greek ===
[[Image:Salaminische Tafel Salamis Tablet nach Wilhelm Kubitschek Numismatische Zeitschrift Bd 31 Wien 1899 p.&amp;nbsp;394 ff.jpg|thumb|upright|An early photograph of the Salamis Tablet, 1899. The original is marble and is held by the National Museum of Epigraphy, in Athens.]]
The earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the Greek abacus dates to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Demosthenes]] (384 BC–322 BC) talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head.&lt;ref name=Will/&gt;&lt;ref name=pull&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A play by [[Alexis (poet)|Alexis]] from the 4th century BC mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting, and both [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] and [[Polybius]] mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less, like the pebbles on an abacus.&lt;ref name=pull/&gt; The Greek abacus was a table of wood or marble, pre-set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations. This Greek abacus saw use in Achaemenid Persia, the Etruscan civilization, Ancient Rome and, until the French Revolution, the Western Christian world.

A tablet found on the Greek island [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in 1846 AD (the [[Salamis Tablet]]), dates back to 300 BC, making it the oldest counting board discovered so far. It is a slab of white marble {{convert|149|cm|0|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|75|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|4.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} thick, on which are 5 groups of markings. In the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line, capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom-most horizontal line and the single vertical line. Below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it. Below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines, again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them, but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection; the third, sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also from this time frame the ''Darius Vase'' was unearthed in 1851. It was covered with pictures including a &quot;treasurer&quot; holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will&quot;/&gt;

===Chinese===
{{Main|Suanpan}}
[[File:abacus 6.png|thumb|[[Suanpan]] (the number represented in the picture is 6,302,715,408)]]
The earliest known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese abacus, known as the [[suanpan]] ([[:zh:算盤|算盤]], lit. &quot;Counting tray&quot;, Mandarin ''suàn pán'', Cantonese ''syun&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; pun&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''), is typically {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. If you move them toward the beam, you count their value. If you move away, you don't count their value.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryerson&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fernandes|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.

Suanpans can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.

In the long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145 AD) during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1297 AD), a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).

The similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.

Another possible source of the suanpan is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal|decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907 AD) when travel in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Middle East]] would have provided direct contact with [[India]], allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the [[decimal point]] from Indian merchants and mathematicians.

===Roman===
{{Main|Roman abacus}}
[[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|thumb|Copy of a [[Roman abacus]]]]
The normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (''calculi'') were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, [[jeton]]s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the [[Roman numeral]] system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[Pope Sylvester II]]'s reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2010|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This abacus used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the abacus could be used much faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huff|1993|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.&lt;ref name=rome&gt;{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of archaeological evidence of the [[Roman abacus]], shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units, five tens etc., essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, obviously related to the [[Roman numerals]]. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman &quot;ounces&quot; (i.e. fractions).

===Indian===
There is no clear evidence for use of the abacus in India. The decimal number system invented in India replaced the abacus in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;UniOfNthC1&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/roman.html|title=Roman and &quot;Arabic&quot; Numerals|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=2004-07-04|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Abhidharmakośabhāṣya]]'' of [[Vasubandhu]] (316-396), a Sanskrit work on Buddhist philosophy, says that the second-century CE philosopher [[Vasumitra]] said that &quot;placing a wick (Sanskrit ''vartikā'') on the number one (''ekāṅka'') means it is a one, while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred, and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand&quot;.  It is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been. Around the 5th century, Indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the Abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Körner|1996|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu texts used the term ''śūnya'' (zero) to indicate the empty column on the abacus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mollin|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese===
{{Main|Soroban}}
[[File:Soroban.JPG|thumb|Japanese [[soroban]]]]
In Japanese, the abacus is called ''[[soroban]]'' ({{lang|ja|算盤, そろばん}}, lit. &quot;Counting tray&quot;), imported from China in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Gul&gt;{{harvnb|Gullberg|1997|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started, as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1/4 abacus, which is suited to decimal calculation, appeared circa 1930, and became widespread as the Japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in China. The abacus is still manufactured in Japan today even with the proliferation, practicality, and affordability of pocket [[electronic calculator]]s. The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation. Using visual imagery of a soroban, one can arrive at the answer in the same time as, or even faster than, is possible with a physical instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murray|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Korean===
The Chinese abacus migrated from China to [[Korea]] around 1400 AD.&lt;ref name=Will&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jami|1998|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koreans call it ''jupan'' (주판), ''supan'' (수판) or ''jusan'' (주산).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American===
[[File:Quipu.png|thumb|Representation of an [[Inca]] [[quipu]]]]
[[File:Yupana 1.png|thumb|A [[yupana]] as used by the Incas.]]
Some sources mention the use of an abacus called a ''nepohualtzintzin'' in ancient [[Aztec]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanyal|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Mesoamerican abacus used a 5-digit base-20 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The word Nepōhualtzintzin {{IPA-nah|nepoːwaɬˈt͡sint͡sin|}} comes from [[Nahuatl]] and it is formed by the roots; ''Ne'' – personal -; ''pōhual'' or ''pōhualli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈpoːwalːi|}} – the account -; and ''tzintzin'' {{IPA-nah|ˈt͡sint͡sin|}} – small similar elements. Its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the [[Calmecac]] to the ''temalpouhqueh'' {{IPA-nah|temaɬˈpoʍkeʔ|}}, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood.

The Nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.

Altogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nepōhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nepōhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nepōhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nepōhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nepōhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1{{sfrac|1|4}} days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in [[floating point]], which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.

The rediscovery of the Nepōhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|pp=94–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been found very old Nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]] culture, and even some bracelets of [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.

George I. Sanchez, &quot;Arithmetic in Maya&quot;, Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the [[Yucatán peninsula]] that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with [[Sylvanus Morley]], a noted Mayanist.

The [[quipu]] of the [[Inca]]s was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albree|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; like advanced [[tally stick]]s – but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for &quot;counting tool&quot;; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aimi|De Pasquale|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian===
[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]
The Russian abacus, the ''schoty'' (счёты), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.

As a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnett|Ryan|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hudgins|2004|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the 1874 invention of [[mechanical calculator]], [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odhner arithmometer]], had not replaced them in [[Russia]] and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leushina|1991|p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of [[Pocket calculator|microcalculators]] had started in the Soviet Union in 1974. Today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator.

The Russian abacus was brought to France around 1820 by the mathematician [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]], who served in [[Napoleon]]'s army and had been a prisoner of war in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trogeman|Ernst|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and [[algorism]]ic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flegg|1983|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and the [[Armenians|Armenian]] people also used abaci similar to the Russian schoty. It was named a ''coulba'' by the Turks and a ''choreb'' by the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School abacus==
[[File:Kugleramme.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Early 20th century abacus used in Danish elementary school.]]
[[File:Telraam.JPG|thumb|A twenty bead ''rekenrek'']]
Around the world, abaci have been used in pre-schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the [[numeral system]] and [[arithmetic]].

In Western countries, a bead frame similar to the Russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common (see image). It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.

The wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abaci (thus the 10-wire version may represent numbers up to 9,999,999,999), or each bead may represent one unit (so that e.g. 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire, so numbers up to 100 may be represented). In the bead frame shown, the gap between the 5th and 6th wire, corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire, suggests the latter use.

The red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of number-related lessons. The twenty bead version, referred to by its [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name ''rekenrek'' (&quot;calculating frame&quot;), is often used, sometimes on a string of beads, sometimes on a rigid framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2011|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses by the blind==
An adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a '''Cranmer abacus''' is still commonly used by individuals who are [[blindness|blind]]. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently. This keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aph&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Terlau|Gissoni|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although blind students have benefited from talking calculators, the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades, both in public schools and state schools for the blind. The abacus teaches mathematical skills that can never be replaced with talking calculators and is an important learning tool for blind students.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Presley|D'Andrea|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a braille-writer and [[Nemeth Braille|Nemeth code]] (a type of braille code for mathematics) but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult. The abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper. Many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life.&lt;ref name=&quot;aph&quot; /&gt;

==Binary abacus==

The binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Good Jr.|1985|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abacus shows how numbers, letters, and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer, or via [[ASCII]]. The device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows. The beads represent a switch on the computer in either an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; position.

[[File:Zn reaction with HCl.JPG|thumb|[[Zinc]], a typical metal, reacting with [[hydrochloric acid]], a typical acid]]
{{Acids and bases}}
An '''acid''' is a [[molecule]] or [[ion]] capable of donating a [[Hydron (chemistry)|hydron]] (proton or hydrogen ion H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), or, alternatively, capable of forming a [[covalent bond]] with an [[electron pair]] (a Lewis acid).&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC_acid&quot;&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00071.html IUPAC Gold Book - acid]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first category of acids is the proton donors or [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|Brønsted acid]]s. In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the [[hydronium ion]] H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and are known as [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius acids]]. [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted|Brønsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry|Lowry]] generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid.&lt;ref&gt;Petrucci R.H., Harwood, R.S. and Herring, F.G. ''General Chemistry'' (8th ed., Prentice-Hall 2002) p.146 {{ISBN|0-13-014329-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acids form [[aqueous solution]]s with a sour taste, can turn blue [[litmus]] red, and react with [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] and certain metals (like [[calcium]]) to form [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. The word ''acid'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''acidus/acēre'' meaning ''sour''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''acid'']&lt;/ref&gt; An aqueous solution of an acid has a [[pH]] less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict definition&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC_acid&quot;/&gt; refers only to the [[solution|solute]]. A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of [[Hydron (chemistry)|positive hydrogen ions]] in the [[solution]]. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be '''acidic'''.

Common aqueous acids include [[hydrochloric acid]] (a solution of [[hydrogen chloride]] which is found in [[gastric acid]] in the stomach and activates [[digestive enzymes]]), [[acetic acid]] (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), [[sulfuric acid]] (used in [[car battery|car batteries]]), and [[citric acid]] (found in citrus fruits). As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC_acid&quot;/&gt; sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. [[Acid strength|Strong acid]]s and some concentrated weak acids are [[corrosive substance|corrosive]], but there are exceptions such as [[carborane]]s and [[boric acid]].

The second category of acids are [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acids]], which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. An example is [[boron trifluoride]] (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), whose boron atom has a vacant [[atomic orbital|orbital]] which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Gilbert N. Lewis|Lewis]] considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly ''or'' by releasing protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby8th&quot;&gt;Oxtoby, D.

In modern terminology, an ''acid'' is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as ''a Lewis acid''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby8th&quot; /&gt;

==Definitions and concepts==
{{main|Acid–base reaction}}
Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.

Most acids encountered in everyday life are [[aqueous solutions]], or can be dissolved in water, so the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant.

The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified, acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from an acid to a base.

Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as [[Lewis base]]s due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

===Arrhenius acids===
[[File:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|150px|Svante Arrhenius]]

The Swedish chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] attributed the properties of acidity to [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or [[proton]]s in 1884. An '''Arrhenius acid''' is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby8th&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot;&gt;Ebbing, D.D., &amp; Gammon, S. D. (2005). ''General chemistry'' (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|0-618-51177-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that chemists often write H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq'') and refer to the [[hydrogen ion]] when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a [[proton]], does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water. Examples include molecular substances such as HCl and acetic acid.

An Arrhenius [[base (chemistry)|base]], on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of [[hydroxide]] (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) ions when dissolved in water. This decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules:

H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + OH{{su|p=−|b=(aq)}} ⇌ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt;

Due to this equilibrium, any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide. Thus, an Arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, while an Arrhenius base increases it.

In an acidic solution, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acidic solutions thus have a pH of less than 7.

===Brønsted–Lowry acids{{anchor|Brønsted acids}}===
{{Main|Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory}}

[[File:Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png|thumb|350px|alt=Acetic acid, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, is composed of a methyl group, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, bound chemically to a carboxylate group, COOH. The carboxylate group can lose a proton and donate it to a water molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0, leaving behind an acetate anion CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO- and creating a hydronium cation H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O. This is an equilibrium reaction, so the reverse process can also take place.|[[Acetic acid]], a [[weak acid]], donates a proton (hydrogen ion, highlighted in green) to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the [[acetate]] ion and the [[hydronium]] ion. Red: oxygen, black: carbon, white: hydrogen.]]

While the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A '''Brønsted-Lowry acid''' (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot; /&gt; Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of [[acetic acid]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH), the [[organic acid]] that gives vinegar its characteristic taste:

:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|−}} + {{chem|H|3|O|+}}
:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|NH|3}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|−}} + {{chem|NH|4|+}}

Both theories easily describe the first reaction: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Brønsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but does not relate to the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Nevertheless, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH is both an Arrhenius and a Brønsted-Lowry acid.

Brønsted-Lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of [[molecule|molecular compounds]] in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase. [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form [[ammonium chloride]], NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as [[hydrochloric acid]] and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition:
# H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + Cl{{su|p=−|b=(aq)}} + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Cl{{su|p=−|b=(aq)}} + NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
# HCl&lt;sub&gt;(benzene)&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3(benzene)&lt;/sub&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;
# HCl&lt;sub&gt;(g)&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3(g)&lt;/sub&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt;

As with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in [[benzene]]) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; combine to form the solid.

===Lewis acids===
{{main article|Lewis acids and bases}}
A third, only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A '''Lewis acid''' is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebbing&quot; /&gt; Brønsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. Many Lewis acids are not Brønsted-Lowry acids. Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry:
:[[File:LewisAcid.png|374px]]
In the first reaction a [[fluoride|fluoride ion]], F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, gives up an [[lone pair|electron pair]] to [[boron trifluoride]] to form the product [[tetrafluoroborate]]. Fluoride &quot;loses&quot; a pair of [[valence electron]]s because the electrons shared in the B—F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Brønsted acid to ammonia, a Brønsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gains a pair of electrons when one of the H—O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] or an [[electrophile]]. Organic Brønsted acids, such as acetic, citric, or oxalic acid, are not Lewis acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby8th&quot; /&gt; They dissociate in water to produce a Lewis acid, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a Lewis base (acetate, citrate, or oxalate, respectively, for the acids mentioned). Few, if any, of the acids discussed in the following are Lewis acids.

==Dissociation and equilibrium==
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Free acid]] --&gt;
Reactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, where HA represents the acid and A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. This reaction is referred to as '''protolysis'''. The protonated form (HA) of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the '''free acid'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Stahl | editor-first1 = P. Heinrich | editor-last2 = Warmth | editor-first2 = Camille G. | last1 = Stahl | first1 = P. Heinrich | last2 = Nakamo | first2 = Masahiro | name-list-format = vanc | title = Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use | date = 2008 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | isbn = 978-3-906390-58-1 | chapter = Pharmaceutical Aspects of the Salt Form | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IvSEXUZUON8C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22free+acid%22+salt&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22free%20acid%22%20salt&amp;f=false | pages = 92–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acid-base conjugate pairs differ by one proton, and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton ([[protonation]] and [[deprotonation]], respectively). Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + A. In solution there exists an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the acid and its conjugate base. The [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'' is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] means ''the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''. The [[acid dissociation constant]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;K_a = \frac\ce{[H+] [A^-]}\ce{[HA]}&lt;/math&gt;
The stronger of two acids will have a higher ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is more frequently used, where p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;minus;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. Stronger acids have a smaller p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; at 25&amp;nbsp;°C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.

==Nomenclature==
In the classical naming system, acids are named according to their [[anion]]s. That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.
For example, HCl has [[chloride]] as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form [[hydrochloric acid]]. In the [[IUPAC]] naming system, &quot;aqueous&quot; is simply added to the name of the ionic compound. Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride. The prefix &quot;hydro-&quot; is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.

==Acid strength==
{{main|Acid strength}}

The strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and one mole of the conjugate base, A&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of [[strong acid]]s are [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.

Stronger acids have a larger ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and a more negative p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; than weaker acids.

Sulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is [[toluenesulfonic acid]] (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, [[polystyrene]] functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.

[[Superacid]]s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are [[fluoroantimonic acid]], [[magic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline [[hydronium]] &quot;salts&quot;. They can also quantitatively stabilize [[carbocation]]s.

While ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.  The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Chemical characteristics==

===Monoprotic acids===
Monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):
:HA&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=−|b=(aq)}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;

Common examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). On the other hand, for [[organic acids]] the term mainly indicates the presence of one [[carboxylic acid]] group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in [[organic acids]] include [[formic acid]] (HCOOH), [[acetic acid]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH) and [[benzoic acid]] (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;COOH).
{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Monoprotic acids}}

===Polyprotic acids===
Polyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).

A diprotic acid (here symbolized by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:{{nowrap|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=−|b=(aq)}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;}}
:{{nowrap|HA{{su|p=−|b=(aq)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=2−|b=(aq)}} &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

The first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO{{su|b=4|p=−}}), for which ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}), wherein the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; is intermediate strength. The large ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}}) and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO{{su|b=3|p=2−}}). Both ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values are small, but ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; .

A triprotic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;.
:{{nowrap|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A{{su|p=−|b=(aq)}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;}}
:{{nowrap|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A{{su|p=−|b=(aq)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=2−|b=(aq)}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
:{{nowrap|HA{{su|p=2−|b=(aq)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=3−|b=(aq)}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a3&lt;/sub&gt;}}

An [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]]. All three protons can be successively lost to yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO{{su|b=4|p=−}}, then HPO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}, and finally PO{{su|b=4|p=3−}}, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]]. Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged. An [[organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion.

Although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, ''α'' (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;A, HA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and A&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha_\ce{H2A}    &amp;= \frac\ce{[H+]^2}{\ce{[H+]^2} + [\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}     = \frac\ce{[H2A]}\ce{{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}
\\
\alpha_\ce{HA^-}   &amp;= \frac{[\ce{H+}]K_1}{\ce{[H+]^2} + [\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2} = \frac\ce{[HA^-]}\ce{{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}
\\
\alpha_\ce{A^{2-}} &amp;= \frac{K_1 K_2}{\ce{[H+]^2} + [\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}      = \frac\ce{[A^{2-}]}\ce{{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
A plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is known as a [[Bjerrum plot]]. A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general ''n'' -protic acid that has been deprotonated ''i'' -times:
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\alpha_{\ce H_{n-i} A^{i-} }= {{[\ce{H+}]^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \over { \displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^n \Big[ [\ce{H+}]^{n-i} \displaystyle \prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \Big] }
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.

===Neutralization===
[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]) reacting with [[ammonia]] fumes to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]]
[[Neutralization (chemistry)|Neutralization]] is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and neutralized base; for example, [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] form [[sodium chloride]] and water:
:HCl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + NaOH&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt; + NaCl&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

Neutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid. It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.

Neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic [[ammonium chloride]], which is produced from the strong acid [[hydrogen chloride]] and the weak base [[ammonia]]. Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g. [[sodium fluoride]] from [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[sodium hydroxide]].

===Weak acid–weak base equilibrium===
{{main|Henderson–Hasselbalch equation}}
In order for a protonated acid to lose a proton, the pH of the system must rise above the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the acid. The decreased concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid). In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form.

Solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.

==Applications of acids==
There are numerous uses for acids. Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as [[pickling (metal)|pickling]]. They may be used as an electrolyte in a [[wet cell battery]], such as [[sulfuric acid]] in a [[car battery]].

Strong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing. For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce [[phosphoric acid]] for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and [[zinc]] is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.

In the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts. For example, [[nitric acid]] reacts with [[ammonia]] to produce [[ammonium nitrate]], a fertilizer. Additionally, [[carboxylic acid]]s can be [[Esterification|esterified]] with alcohols, to produce [[ester]]s.

Acids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives. [[Phosphoric acid]], for example, is a component of [[cola]] drinks. Acetic acid is used in day-to-day life as vinegar. Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.  Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.

[[Tartaric acid]] is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind. Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids. [[Citric acid]] is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits. [[Oxalic acid]] is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in [[carambola]] and [[rhubarb]]; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.

[[Ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla ([[Phyllanthus emblica|Indian gooseberry]]), lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.

Certain acids are used as drugs. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.

Acids play important roles in the human body. The hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules. Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues. Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues. Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA and RNA and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes. Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.

===Acid catalysis===
{{Main|Acid catalysis}}
Acids are used as [[catalyst]]s in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, [[sulfuric acid]] is used in very large quantities in the [[alkylation]] process to produce gasoline. Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] and [[condensation reaction]]s. In biochemistry, many [[enzyme]]s employ acid catalysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet acid cat&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Voet, Judith G.|author2=Voet, Donald |title=Biochemistry |publisher=J.

==Biological occurrence==
[[Image:Aminoacid.png|thumb|left|Basic structure of an [[amino acid]].]]Many biologically important molecules are acids. [[Nucleic acid]]s, which contain acidic [[phosphate|phosphate groups]], include [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of [[protein]]s which are made up of [[amino acid]] subunits. [[Cell membrane]]s contain [[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s such as [[phospholipids]].

An α-amino acid has a central carbon (the α or [[alpha and beta carbon|''alpha'' carbon]]) which is covalently bonded to a [[carboxyl]] group (thus they are [[carboxylic acid]]s), an [[amine|amino]] group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In [[glycine]], the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and almost invariably occur in the [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: D- and L-|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-configuration]]. [[Peptidoglycan]], found in some bacterial [[cell wall]]s contains some &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and the basic amine group (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gains a proton (-NH{{su|b=3|p=+}}). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a [[zwitterion]], with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. [[Aspartic acid]], for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of −1 at physiological pH.

Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] &quot;head&quot; groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.

In humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]] to help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce [[formic acid]].

Acid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating [[mammal]]ian breathing. [[molecular oxygen|Oxygen]] gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) drives [[cellular respiration]], the process by which animals release the chemical [[potential energy]] stored in food, producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the [[lungs]], and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored [[carbohydrate]]s and fat, releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exists in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] ion.
: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO{{su|b=3|p=−}}
It is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and resupplying the cells with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid) is a [[carboxylic acid]].]] [[Cell membrane]]s are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and [[cytosol]], both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the [[intracellular pH]] will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. [[Ibuprofen]], [[aspirin]] and [[penicillin]] are examples of drugs that are weak acids.
